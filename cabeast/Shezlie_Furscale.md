# Shezlie Furscale
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Shezlie Furscale says:** Be careful around here. Soandso. Injured broodlings are no use to anyone. Many of these structures are yet unstable and could fall at any time. If you're a mystic, I can teach you how to [protect] yourself.

**You say:** `oxyn sent me`



>**Shezlie Furscale says:** It is good to see that more able bodies are passing through the doors of the Temple of Terror. We should be able to rebuild much faster now, once we are able to [collect some more bundles]. For those that are interested in helping, there is [payment] to be had.

**You say:** `collect some more bundle`



>**Shezlie Furscale says:** There are many bundles to be collected. There are only four that I require at this very instant. I need a bundle that contains Bargynn's Digger, Sythrax's building plans, a sapphire, and your banded helm. Another must contain some venomous parchment, warlord drawing pen, a ruby, and your banded guantlets. There is one that must have a recruitment letter, an exiled iksar head, a fire emerald, and your banded leggings. And the final bundle I require must contain some watchman's spectacles, nectar of isolation, a star ruby, and your banded tunic. Now, hurry and return these, or I'll be asking for someone to bring me your head.

**You say:** `payment`



>**Shezlie Furscale says:** Payment will be in the form of equipment. All funds are currently being spent on the rebuilding.
