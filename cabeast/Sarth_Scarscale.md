# Sarth Scarscale


## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>*Sarth Scarscale hisses at you loudly. 'So, you bear the [mantle of a crusader], yes?  I am known as Sarth and shall reward you, provided you prove your worthiness to our cause, child of Rile.'*

**You say:** `mantle of a crusader`



>**Sarth Scarscale says:** We shall see if you are worthy of that. I shall make [armor] for you, to aid you in your service to our Father. I specialize in the forging of [bracers], [greaves], [masks], and [breastplates]. Sirtha makes the other items of armor. Take care when you address her, hatchling. It would not be the first time a hatchling has left here with scars.

**You say:** `armor`

**You say:** `bracers`



>**Sarth Scarscale says:** Have you ever seen Bloodgills? I hear they will devour a broodling in seconds and that their scales are tough as iron. Bring me some of these scales, a banded bracer, and a sapphire as blue as the sky. Only then will I give the bracer to you, broodling.

**You say:** `greaves`



>**Sarth Scarscale says:** Do you know the beasts that call themselves sarnaks? One such beast who calls itself Zorash attacked an envoy of merchants who were to deliver a pair of special boots to me. It taunts us by wearing them as a trophy. Bring them back and the skull of Grachnist, his goblin ally. Return them to me along with a star ruby and your banded greaves, and I shall craft you an excellent pair of greaves.

**You say:** `mask`



>**Sarth Scarscale says:** Have you ever encountered a drixie before? I crush every one I see. They are an annoyance beyond mere words! Kill the Queen and bring me her wings as a trophy along with an emerald of fire and a banded mask.

**You say:** `breastplate`



>**Sarth Scarscale says:** Ahhhh....a breastplate you want, is it? Well, they are not easy to come by. Fetch me a scorpion chitin. Intact, mind you! They are extremely fragile and must be treated before they can protect your carcass. Also, fetch me a war braid from a sarnak to connect the pieces. I also require a ruby and your banded tunic. Do this and I shall make it for you, hatchling. Now, go!
