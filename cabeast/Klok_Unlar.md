# Klok Unlar


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>*Klok Unlar wipes flour from his hands and turns to greet you. 'Welcome! Please look over my many treats. Do not think of the coin you shall spend. Heavy coin buys the finest and sweetest of treats. Feel free to ask me about any of the rare pies you see as I can tell you exactly how I make them.*

**You say:** `bixie berry pie`



>**Klok Unlar says:** Bixie berry pie?!!  It is no treat and is poisonous to the Iksar.  We use it to keep our froglok slaves nourished.  My apprentice baker, Bugrin, bakes them and delivers them to the slaves.  Only he has access to the bixie berry pie recipe.  All the pies are eaten by the slaves. If you think you have one, you must be mistaken.  Let me see it if you believe you have one.
