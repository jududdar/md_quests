**You say:** `hail`



>**The Toilmaster says:** Do not bother me unless you wish to join the chain gang. Now go away or I shall have my slaves chop you as they chop this granite!

**You say:** `hammer`




>*The Toilmaster hands you a massive hammer and says, 'So, you can read. Good for you. Don't think that you're going to make an impression on me with that rubbish. Let's see if you can handle this hammer like you can that book, whelp.'*

**You say:** `pebbles`





>**The Toilmaster says:** Ah. Looking for granite pebbles, are we? You must be a Swifttail. I am tired of doing your caste's work when you give nothing in return. Tell you what, I have lost many slaves to escape. If you bash their heads in with your many skills and return at least two busted froglok shackles I will give you one pile of granite pebbles.

**You say:** `who.* king`




>**The Toilmaster says:** Sss...  All hail Emperor Vekin.  He shall restore the glory of the Iksar Empire.  He shall reclaim Old Sebilis and slay Trakanon!  Hail the mighty Emperor Vekin or lose thy head!

>*The Toilmaster looks at the tome and speaks to you, scowling, 'Very well Broodling, I have a task for you. I should make you work at the feet of my Froglok Slaves, crushing granite, but the lore of the Brood has a specific rite for this situation. Take this book and learn the will of Cazic-Thule. Read it and ask me any questions that you may have before you start your penance. It would be a shame for you to fail at this task as well... though I wouldn't mind destroying you.*
