# Sirtha Scarscale


## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>*Sirtha Scarscale eyes you intently. 'So, yet another hatchling approaches us. I am known as Sirtha and that is Sarth. We are of [Rile's] children. Who do you call your father, broodling?'*

**You say:** `Rile`



>**Sirtha Scarscale says:** Very good. We are smiths for the Crusaders of the Greenmist and I shall make [armor] for you, provided you prove your worth. Fail these simple tasks, and you shall not be worthy to bear the title of crusader!

**You say:** `armor`



>**Sirtha Scarscale says:** I will make [helms], [gauntlets], [boots], and [vambraces]. My broodmate shall make the bracers, greaves, masks, and breastplate.

**You say:** `helm`



>**Sirtha Scarscale says:** The sarnak are a mockery of the Iksar. They are nothing more than beasts fit only to do our bidding! I require you to bring me the sword of one of their Order of Knights and the head of a sarnak berserker. These beasts have been attacking our patrols of late. I also require a stone called a ruby and a banded helm. Do this and I shall make a helm for you.

**You say:** `boots`



>**Sirtha Scarscale says:** Cactus quills can be very lethal. I seek to work them into my new boots. Find me these quills, a pair of skeletal feet, an emerald of fire, and some banded boots so that I may start working on them. Why are you still here?! Begone!

**You say:** `gauntlets`



>**Sirtha Scarscale says:** I currently have need of a complete skeletal hand for the research I am conducting. I wish to study its properties and form so that I can make gauntlets befitting our station. I also require two rubies that holds stars within and some banded gauntlets to complete my ritual. Do that and the gauntlets are yours to keep.

**You say:** `vambraces`



>**Sirtha Scarscale says:** The hideous Golra are hardy creatures. The tales indicate their ferocity almost matches our own. I wish to gain a trophy of one of these beasts. Bring me the skin of one, two blue sapphires, and banded sleeves. Then I shall give you these fine vambraces.
