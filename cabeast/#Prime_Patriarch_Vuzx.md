# Prime Patriarch Vuzx
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Prime Patriarch Vuzx says:** Greetings. I only train those who follow the path of the Patriarchs of Cabilis and have yet to develop their [powers] over the beasts of the wild.

**You say:** `powers`




>**Prime Patriarch Vuzx says:** A Patriarch of Cabilis must learn to survive the hard way, by heading into the wild lands and mastering the creatures that reside in them. First you must learn to defeat even the most insignificant of nuisances. Go from this temple and return to me with four Leech Husks that have been skinned from the creatures by your own claws.

>**Prime Patriarch Vuzx says:** You have overcome sturdy yet unintelligent creatures that plague our kind. You are now ready to face our foes that are more intelligent than the insects you have defeated. We have many foes possessing a degree of intelligence, the least of these foes being the tribes of goblins that inhabit our Empires lands. Even now there are goblin watchers prowling just outside our gates. Locate four of these watchers, slay them and return to me with their Goblin Watcher Signal Torches.

>**Prime Patriarch Vuzx says:** You have triumphed over the watchers, young patriarch, but they are among the weakest of our sentient foes.

It is time for you to face the Goblin Hunters, and learn of our enemies the Sarnak, a species of dragonmen that once served the Iksar Empires of old. Journey to the wilderness and return with two Goblin Hunter Javelins and two Sarnak Broodling Fangs.
