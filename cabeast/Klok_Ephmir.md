## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>*Klok Ephmir stares at you with a wicked smirk. 'So you share the Brood's love of frogloks, do you? Alive, they provide much trouble. Dead, they provide much delight. I have found many uses for the frogloks. From fine meat to fine mats. Be sure to ask if you do not see something you desire.'*

**You say:** `i need thinly sliced froglok`






>**Klok Ephmir says:** I can provide thin sliced froglok meat, or rather, I used to. First I need to [sharpen the dull cutting disk].

**You say:** `sharpen.*disk`






>**Klok Ephmir says:** That would be good. If you are a blacksmith, I am sure you can find a sharpening stone and bring life back in my disk. If you sharpen this I shall gladly provide you with some thin sliced froglok.


**You receive:**  [Dull Cutting Disk](/item/12449)

**You say:** `outlander`



>*Klok Ephmir turns pale at the mention of the Outlander. 'The Outlander!! That is what the lizards in the Tink N' Babble have dubbed him!! He is tall and strong. Get close enough and he will kill you on sight!! I think he could even defeat the likes of Bruiser Noz!! I spotted him near the edge of the swamps. He was headed toward the fields of Firiona.'*
