# Prime Hierophant Vek
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Prime Hierophant Vek says:** Praise to the ancients, my friend! There is much suffering to be given unto the world. I am the Prime Hierophant of the Temple of Terror.  Through me and my fellow priests flows the wisdom of our ancestors.

**You say:** `unique weapon`



>**Prime Hierophant Vek says:** This goblin is known as a pit fighter. Though they are small, weak, and unintelligent, they still maintain a level of ferocity that surpasses that of most wild animals. This, along with a disgusting and perverse imagination, has allowed these pit fighters to reach heights of physical power most Iksar never see. This paticular fighter uses his tongue liberally while fighting. He has ingested many deadly contagions and licked things from the slimy surfaces of the darkest and dankest crevasses imaginable. His tongue will do well to further our cause in pain and suffering.
