# Solvedi Aldeberan
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Solvedi Aldeberan says:** Hail, forestwalker. Welcome to the Rathe bear preserve of the Unkempt Druids. We strive to protect nature with diligence and punish her [defilers] with prejudice!

**You say:** `defilers`



>**Solvedi Aldeberan says:** There are many defilers of nature about that warrant eradication. Groi Gutblade is a loathsome troll poacher who lurks in South Karana. Slay him and bring me his Lionhide Backpack. Timbur the Tiny takes pride in crushing the trees in North Karana into pulp under his feet. Make him pay for this affront and bring me his Laceless Sandal as proof of his demise. I will give you my own blade if you succeed.
