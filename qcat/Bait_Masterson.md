# Bait Masterson
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Bait Masterson says:** You know.. I took up fishing because it was a nice, quiet activity. Most of all, I took it up to avoid conversing with strangers. Get the picture?!!

**You say:** `blessing of prexus`



>**Bait Masterson says:** Prexus!!? Aye!! I once followed the ways of the Ocean Lord. I remember those days. So clear and peaceful were they. I shall make a deal with you, my friend. I shall give up fishing if you give me your guild tunic. With such a tunic I shall once again be compelled to follow the peaceful ways of the Ocean Lord.

**You say:** `donate`



>**Bait Masterson says:** If I were to donate, it would not be to a temple which follows the Rainkeeper. There is no greater deity than Prexus, the Oceanlord.
