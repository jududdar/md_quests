# Teydar


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Teydar says:** Hello Soandso, it's good to see another shadowknight around here. I'm Teydar. I've made it my life to fashion suitable scabbards and sheaths for our order.

**You say:** `decrepit sheath`



>**Teydar says:** The object you desire is very difficult to fashion. Nearly impossible, really. All I can offer to do is try. The real difficulty is the contents that give the sheath its power. They have to be of an almost equal evil. I think some kind of decrepit hide and a drake spine, along with a bar of enchanted platinum, should prove enough to make this item.
