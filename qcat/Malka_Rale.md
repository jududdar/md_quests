## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Malka Rale says:** Whew! I thought you were one of Hanns' goons. These sewers are a mess, you never know what is going to turn up next. I really wish I could get out of here.

**You say:** `hanns`



>**Malka Rale says:** Hanns runs the Circle of Unseen Hands. They had an item someone hired me to.. reacquire. I managed to get the item, stealing it right from the heart of the guild hall. The problem is, I had to carve a way out, and left a few extra holes in several of Hanns' people. I have been trapped down here in these stinking catacombs and sewers for too long now, and I do not think I can get out of here without some help.

**You say:** `help`



>**Malka Rale says:** Ok! I am trusting you. Take this pouch to Vilnius in West Karana. Last word I had from him, he was hanging out near one of the bandit camps. Be careful, since he does not know you. Just give him the pouch, and tell him I was..delayed. While you are doing that, I will be thinking of a way to get out of this slimehole. With any luck, the Circle will learn the pouch is out of Qeynos, and will assume I got away. That means they won't be looking for me here.
