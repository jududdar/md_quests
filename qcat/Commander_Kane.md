# Commander Kane


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Commander Kane says:** Do you know who I am?!  I am the Commander of the Qeynos Guard!  Do you think I trod through these sewers to speak with you?  If so, then you are quite sadly mistaken.

**You say:** `bloodsabers`



>**Commander Kane says:** Bloodsabers!?  You must be new.  Your shrine serves me well.  You shall all be rewarded once I rule.  No doubt you have not come to waste the time of the future emperor.  Are you seeking [new information]

**You say:** `new information`



>**Commander Kane says:** I have gotten word from Guard McCluskey that the young knights of the Temple of Life and the Hall of Thunder have been holding contests to see who is the fleetest.  Every so often, they send a young knight to run the paths of the Plains of Karana and back.  Lone young knights are easy targets for experienced Bloodsabers.

**You say:** `shrine of bertoxxulous`



>**Commander Kane says:** All information about that accursed place is confidential. If you find any information pertaining to the Shrine of Bertoxxulous you must bring it to me immediately.

**You say:** `antonius`



>**Commander Kane says:** How dare you speak the name of Antonius Bayle around me!  Brother he may be, but ruler he is not!  We could not possibly have been sired by the same person.  The empire of Qeynos would stretch as far as Freeport if I were in control.  Emperor Kane...  I like the sound of that!



**You say:** `milea`



>**Commander Kane says:** Milea Clothspinner is an old flame of mine.  She would have made a fine wife.  Unfortunately for me, she chose to become a fine warrior.

**You say:** `nerissa`



>**Commander Kane says:** You keep your eyes off that sweet, innocent girl! She is under my care.



**You say:** `the disease is spreading`



>**Commander Kane says:** Good to see you, my friend. S'ragg said he would be sending his finest. I pray he is right. Do you feel like [going to Highpass] or [going home]?

**You say:** `going home`



>**Commander Kane says:** Just as well.  Get the shrine to send me someone of strength.  No more cowards!

**You say:** `going to Highpass`



>**Commander Kane says:** You will be taking this with you. Give this marked bottle to a man called Barn Bloodstone. He is known to hang around a place called the Golden Rooster. He has a package for me. He will then give you instructions to your next destination. Now, be off! Time is of the essence!

>**Commander Kane says:** Good Work, friend. I still need the other parts. You'd best hope no other gets to them first and returns them to me first. If they do you get no payment.
