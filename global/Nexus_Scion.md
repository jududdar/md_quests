## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Nexus Scion says:** Hello Soandso. I do not have much time to chat. I must concentrate on the portal that is due to open soon. If you wish to [journey to Luclin], tell me so.

**You say:** `journey to Luclin`



>**Nexus Scion says:** Take this, Soandso.  You must stay  inside the circle of the Spires, and keep this shard on your person.  Should you need another, simply ask me.  I do not think we will run out of shards any time soon!  If you do NOT wish to travel to Luclin, destroy that which I gave you, or step well away from the Spires lest you be caught up in the portal. It will open soon.


**You receive:**  [Spire Stone](/item/19720)
