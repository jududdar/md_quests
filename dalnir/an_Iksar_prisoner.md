# an Iksar prisoner


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>*an Iksar prisoner squints at you and gasps when he recognizes notoriety within Iksar society. He scrambles to his feet and says, 'Please, brother! Get me out of these chains so that I may escape back to Cabilis! They intend to coerce me like the others. A more tragic fate no Iksar should endure. I implore you to [help] me!'*

**You say:** `help`



>**an Iksar prisoner says:** Well some of the brainwashed short ones seem to know much of mechanical devices and such. Perhaps they have a tool that can get me out of these chains. If they have anything that looks useful bring it to me. I'm sure your help will be rewarded once I reach Cabilis.
