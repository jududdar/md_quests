# Mystic Pikor


## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Mystic Pikor says:** The mystics of New Tanaan greet Soandso openly. Do not be afraid of Pikor. for my appearance betrays my nature in this place. All are Pikor's equals. and none below me. I am a mystic of Innoruuk. but my faith in the dark father is not of blood and death any longer. Pikor is of knowledge and power beyond Norrath. and I must cast down my guidance of the eye and turn to the spirit. as shall you when your time comes. If you are a shaman. Pikor may guide you as I have scribed my memory of spells no longer useful here for shaman who seek and need the power.
