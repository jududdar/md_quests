>**Zalil Nyvin says:** How do you do, Soandso? So you think you're skilled in the art of magic, do you? Pay close attention for this course I have for you will test your magical prowess like none before. In order to continue my work I will need for you to bring back a few things for me. When you can locate a Tornado Gem, a Battle Worn Trinket, and a Blue Diamond, return and hand them to me along with your Intermediate Magic Manual. If you can do this, then perhaps maybe there is a shred of hope left for you after all! Be off now and good luck!

>**Zalil Nyvin says:** How do you do, Soandso? I wish I could say I had time to chat but despite appearances I am actually quite busy. As a teacher of magic I need to constantly update my lesson plans. Would you be interested in learning from me? I would be happy to teach you but my course is quite advanced. and I can sense you may not quite be ready yet. Please return when you have become so.
