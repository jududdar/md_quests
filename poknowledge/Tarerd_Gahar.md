# Tarerd Gahar



## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Tarerd Gahar says:** I'm sorry Soandso, I have neither the time nor the patience to chat right now.


**You say:** `pool`



>**Tarerd Gahar says:** Oh Tatlan and Wicas sent you did they? I'll tell you what I told them, nothing is free. If you want to know about the pools then I need something [from you] first.

**You say:** `from me`



>**Tarerd Gahar says:** I'm sure it'll be easy for an adventurer as you. I am working on a potion, and I cannot currently travel to gather my last component. If you could bring me the blood of a Sarnak I'd be willing to share what I know.
