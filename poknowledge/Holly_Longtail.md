## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Holly Longtail says:** Hello, Soandso. The preservation of ancestors is a time-honored tradition. It's a task one must handle with painstaking care and precision. Please do not fret for the lives of these specimens. They live in the eternal realm of beauty now. I have quite a large collection of stuffed animals ready to go, but many of them have sustained injuries in their capture. In fact, I wouldn't mind some help to collect some [replacement parts] from creatures around the world.

Seal the box tightly and return it to me. If the contents are in sufficient and usable condition, I may have a reward for you.

It is her dream to turn life's love into something truly grand. She also carries with her the Collector's Boxes. If you need one, be sure to ask her for it.
