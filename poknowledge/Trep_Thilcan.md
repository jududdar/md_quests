# Trep Thilcan




## Dialog

if(**Your level** < 35) then


**Trep Thilcan says one of the following:**

>Someone with your skills is more suited to beetle slaying.  Run along, now.

>This matter is far too advanced for you to handle.  Come back after you've killed a few more large rats.

>It's much safer for you to spend time fishing than on a dangerous issue like this.

>I think I saw a gnoll pup you could probably defeat, a few miles back.

**You say:** `hail`



>**Trep Thilcan says:** Hi! You wouldn't be able to do a favor for a poor gnome would you?

**You say:** `will do you a favor`



>**Trep Thilcan says:** Well I am trying to setup a shop here, it is such a choice location! I am afraid if I leave though that nasty Halfling over there may steal my spot! She has been watching me keenly all day. I know she is just waiting for me to walk away. If you would go purchase some supplies for me from various locations around the world I would be able to reward you for your time spent. If you are ready to begin?'

**You say:** `ready to begin`



>**Trep Thilcan says:** Great! Here is a special crate.  It needs to be filled with a purification tablet from Freeport, a keg of beer from Qeynos, a ball of twine from Shadeweaver, a bundle of weapons from Firiona, an armor assortment from Thurgadin, and a case of meat from the Bazaar.  That should give me quite a stock of items to sell to travelers out here.

>**Trep Thilcan says:** Fantastic! You got me everything I need to set up shop.  Here is some money for your troubles.  I hoped you learned something as well. I am sorry I have nothing more to give you except this advice, if you combine a clockwork carapace, a metal rod, gnomish bolts, firewater and grease in a toolbox you should get something nice!
