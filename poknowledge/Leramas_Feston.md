>**Leramas Feston says:** I hope your first teachings have taught you well, Soandso. It is time for your next lesson. The accumulation of knowledge requires exploration and study. If you explore the cave system in the Plane of Disease, you may eventually discover a foul being by the name of Rallius Rattican. You are to bring me his head, along with your Beginner Stealth Manual. Once done, we may proceed with your next lesson.

>**Leramas Feston says:** Hello and welcome to New Tanaan.  You are currently standing inside the Tanaan meeting hall. please feel free to relax and let your mind rest for a time here.  Surely the adventures of planar travel must have you weary by now.  The exploration of knowledge is a noble cause indeed. I have dedicated my life to helping others with their studies.  Perhaps once you have achieved a certain level of readiness you should seek me out again.
