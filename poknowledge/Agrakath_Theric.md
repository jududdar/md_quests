## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>*Agrakath Theric regards you indifferently.  'You appear to be new around here, as I have not seen your face walking these streets before.  If you have come seeking knowledge, the library of Myrist will be a most excellent resource for you.  If you have come for any other reason, I'm afraid your quest will not go very far with me, as I do not have much time to hear of your escapades.  Good day.'*

**You say:** `erase the debt`



>*Agrakath Theric grins and says, 'So, that weasel Caden has sent you to settle his debt? And you actually agreed to this endeavor? Ha ha, very well! I shall transfer the responsibility of what Caden owes me to your shoulders. I have a simple job for you. Somewhere in the library there lies a book I have been searching for, but it has eluded me for quite some time. I believe it can be found somewhere in the upper levels. You are to venture into Myrist and seek out a tome titled History of Evils: The Age of Scale, and bring it to me. Do this one task for me and your debt shall be relinquished.'*
