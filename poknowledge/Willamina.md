>**Willamina says:** How wonderful! To pass the time I enjoy sitting under the trees and sewing together luscious fabrics. But now it seems my old sewing needles have all broke or gone dull, and I require a new supply. Bolcen Tendag has promised to purchase and deliver some for me, but he has not yet arrived and I worry about him. If you could locate him and ask him about the needles I would appreciate it.
