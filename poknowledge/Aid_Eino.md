>**Aid Eino says:** Greetings Soandso! I am Eino, Monk of Quellious and Aid to Councilwoman Kerasha! I spend my time as protector to the councilwoman as well as taking small jaunts to the planes to obtain items for her magic research. If you be a hearty individual with some allies you may be able to help me.

>**Aid Eino says:** Then meet me this night in the Plane of Nightmares. Near the waterfall of the upper plateau is a large tree. Should you see a soft glow, know that I am about. Signal to me by saying 'Quellious be my guide'. I shall emerge from my concealment.
