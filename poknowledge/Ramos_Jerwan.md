# Ramos Jerwan


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Ramos Jerwan says:** Good day, traveler. Many curious people about these recent days, all inquiring in their thirst for knowledge and personal advancement. Well, if you lead the humble life of a fisherman, or break from the squalls of battle for some peace and quiet at a river or sea shore, then you have come to the right man. All the supplies any fisherman needs may be purchased at my shop, though if for some reason I do not possess that which you are seeking, perhaps my comrade, Daeld, will.  Or have you come perhaps to help me with my studies?

**You say:** `studies`



>**Ramos Jerwan says:** It's quite simple really. I'm interested in studying some aquatic specimens from around the planes... will you take up your pole and give me a hand?

**You say:** `hand`



>**Ramos Jerwan says:** There are some particularly interesting cichlid swimming about in the Plane of Nightmare. I also hear the discus in the Plane of Valor are quite plentiful. I need you to bring me two sets of bones from each for study. You do know how to extract them, yes? If not, I believe the lovely Peras Glickon may have something that can instruct you. Best of luck lad.
