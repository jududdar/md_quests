>**Xasri Virek says:** Welcome my student. I see you have brought with you the Beginner's Manual. If you are ready for your next lesson, the task is simple. A vicious terror has awoken somewhere in the Plane of Innovation. You must seek out the Junk Beast and bring me its power source along with your Beginner Combat Manual. Doing this will prove your battle courage above all else. Remember, the gem cannot be polished without friction, nor man or lizard perfected without trials. I wish you luck.
