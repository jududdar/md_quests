                                href="/item/28788" data-url="28788" class="tooltip-link link">Beginner Combat Manual</a> x 1



>**Xasri Virek says:** Welcome my student. I see you have brought with you the Beginner's Manual. If you are ready for your next lesson, the task is simple. A vicious terror has awoken somewhere in the Plane of Innovation. You must seek out the Junk Beast and bring me its power source along with your Beginner Combat Manual. Doing this will prove your battle courage above all else. Remember, the gem cannot be polished without friction, nor man or lizard perfected without trials. I wish you luck.

>**Xasri Virek says:** Hail. and welcome to the Kartis meeting hall.  I trust you are keeping busy here in New Tanaan?  It is truly a wonderful city. there are many interesting new things to discover here.  I came here from my home of Cabilis long ago. but I could not dream of returning now.  My life is here. wading in the font of knowledge that this place has to offer.  Hopefully I will be able to help you discover your own knowledge one day.
