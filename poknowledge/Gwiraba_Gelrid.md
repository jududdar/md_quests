**You say:** `Hail`



if(**You possess item:**  [Intermediate Combat Manual](/item/28790) x 1



>**Gwiraba Gelrid says:** Good day to you, Soandso. By the looks of things you have learned quite a bit about planar combat already, but if you wish to be truly knowledgeable on the subject, there is one last course you must undertake. Using your newfound courage and bravery, you must collect for me a Sandstorm Gem, a Rage Filled Gem, and a Blue Diamond. Bring me these items along with your Intermediate Combat Manual. And remember, unless you have the moral nerve to live out your convictions, they are of little account.

>**Gwiraba Gelrid says:** Good day to you, Soandso. Are you new to this cirty or have you been a long time resident? I'm afraid I do not get to run about and explore like I used to, as my studies keep me quite busy. If you have the time and inclination, I would suggest you explore the land some more. Then perhaps one day when you return, you will be redy to learn what I have to teach you.
