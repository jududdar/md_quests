**You say:** `hail`



>**Nul Aleswiller says:** Hail, Soandso!  What brings you out this way?  I am the leader of the [Fangbreakers].  We are employed by the [people of the Plains of Karana] to keep their homeland free of [lycanthropes].  We are on the trail of several particularly nasty [werewolves].

Cory is our tracker and scout.  My tall friend Bunu keeps us all healthy as well as lending some added muscle to the group.

**You say:** `werewolves`



>**Nul Aleswiller says:** Lycanthropes or werewolves, as the peasants call them, are humans, barbarians or Erudites who are cursed with a dread disease which, under the light of the moon, transforms them into ravenous beasts of great strength and even greater hunger for living flesh.  They prowl these hills, so beware!

**You say:** `karana`



>**Nul Aleswiller says:** The Plains of Karana are home to many different people of many races, but most of them are humans.  They are mainly farmers by trade.
