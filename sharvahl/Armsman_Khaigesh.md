# Armsman Khaigesh
## Dialog

**You say:** `lesson`



>**Armsman Khaigesh says:** A warrior must learn to be patient and pay attention to detail. Take the bag that I've just given you and fill it with Acrylia flecked nuggets. When hunting the moor, we often found rocks and ore wedged in the shells of the beetles that roam there. Kill the beetles that walk near the city's gates and pry their shells apart. You should be able to gather a decent amount of ore that way. Once you've filled the bag that I've given you, return here with the bag and your Skeletonbane short sword and I'll teach you something new.

## Turn-Ins

>**Armsman Khaigesh says:** I can see by your armaments, that Hebijeb has started you along the path of bravery. That's a very good foundation for a young Khala Dun recruit to build upon. Bravery is an important trait, but you will need to learn discipline and patience. The blacksmithing that we do as Khala Dun helps to reinforce and reflect upon those traits. Take this bag and I will help you with your next [lesson].
