>**Kery Miann says:** You have done very well, youth. I hope that you are beginning to understand what it means to walk the path of Khati Sha. Public service is very important. Our namesake is the fundamental figure in the foundation of this society. Our walls are made of the ore that he discovered. His exploration of the lands that surround our home made it possible for us to live here in peace. This leads us to our next lesson. I would like you to seek out the caverns beyond the thicket. A breed of shelled creatures roam the tunnels of those caverns. Occasionally, a strong glow will manifest itself in one of these creatures. Find such a creature and bring me the source of its glow. Wrap the light source in your Khati Sha recruit's cloak and place them both in this box.

'Your life as a member of our sect may not always be pleasant, but take comfort in the fact that you are performing a great service to your people. Walk the path of the Khati Sha with pride and one day may you see his face as I have. Now, seek out Kaam Rahiir in the libraries.
