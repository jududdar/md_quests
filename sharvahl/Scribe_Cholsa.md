# Scribe Cholsa


## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Scribe Cholsa says:** Things slip my mind easily these days. Are you here for something specific or are you a one of our new recruits?

**You say:** `components`



>**Scribe Cholsa says:** The legends instruct that the ritual requires an Amulet of Golden Rays crafted by a worshiper of the sun, Charcoal that burns with a Black Flame, and the Brain of a creature that can Leech the Thoughts of others. If you manage to procure these items please take them with the instructions I have provided to Spiritualist Roleko at the Grimling Forest Outpost. The Rakshasa shall be summoned and slain there away from the citizens of Shar Vahl.

## Turn-Ins



if **You turn in:** [Rolekos Report of Occurrences](/item/31849)


>**Scribe Cholsa says:** So it seems there is more truth to the legends of the Rakshasa than is commonly believed. I recall much of the tales of the wicked shaman who sold their souls and bodies to the dark spirits.  There is a ritual that must be performed to force the Rakshasa to fully materialize in our realm so that it may be slain. I will write down the instructions for the ritual but the [components] I'm afraid may be difficult to obtain.
