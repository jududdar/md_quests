## Turn-Ins



if( **You turn in:** [Acrylia Slate of Shar Vahl](/item/2877)) then 


>**Animist Poren says:** I have much for you to do Soandso. There is great need for capable Khati Sha in this new land. It is important that you progress speedily. We need to outfit you with the equipment that defines our chosen path. Well start with your battleclaws... But be aware of the fact that it will take you some time before can use both sets in combat. Just keep them both with you while you learn.


>**Animist Poren says:** Take this stitching pack and combine two shade silks from the xakra worms. Combine two of the resulting threads to make a bandage. Take this pattern and sew together three of the bandages. With considerable practice this will produce the handwraps that will be a foundation for your first sacred weapon. When you have created them return to me the scrap material.


 **You receive:** GiveAll( [Stitching Pack](/item/17237), [Acrylia Slate of Shar Vahl](/item/2877), [Khati Sha Handwrap Pattern](/item/3663)) 

elseif( **You turn in:** [Shade Silk Scraps](/item/3665)) then 


>**Animist Poren says:** Ahh, you have done well young one. Now it is time for you to create claws of your own, and those handwraps are the base. You will need a few things to complete them, however. Combine those handwraps in your stitching pack along with two sharp claws from the young rockhoppers in the pit around our city, as well as some forged fasteners.


>**Animist Poren says:** Im afraid I am unsure where you can find the fasteners, though you might ask Kagazz about them. You can find him over near the forges. Return and hand me both claws, and your cloak as proof of your deeds.


>**Animist Poren says:** Oh, and dont worry about destroying your handwraps. They are well made and though you may not be successful in making your claws, they will last. Now you best move along and get started, as we still have much to do!
