## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Hymnist Gawfed says:** Very well met, young friend. I assume that Gherik has sent you to me for the purpose of training you. Unforunately, I will not be doing any formal training for the several days. I'm taking a bit of a holiday to celebrate my wife's birthday. If you could take this receipt to the [merchant] for me before my wife gets home, I'd appreciate it. I'll place you at the top of my training list as well.


**You receive:**  [Gawfeds Receipt](/item/5954)

**You say:** `merchant`



>**Hymnist Gawfed says:** Gah... I'm losing my wits. I didn't tell you which merchant. Well, the fur is the first thing to go, and the mind is a close second. My wife's birthday is usually quite a large event in my household and I've been trying to make this one extra special. I'm lucky I can still find my tail. Take the note to Jihli Mahej. He's an importer who lives near the... gah! I can't remember the address. I'm sure you'll find him though. Good luck!

'I need to properly thank you for retrieving it for me and I think that I know just the thing. If you gather some owlbear feathers I can have my brother apply them to your cloak. He can make a cloak really stand out. It will be a prize fit for any aspiring apprentice to wear. Take this sack and fill it with seven feathers and your recruit's cloak.
