## Signals

>**Pathmaster Kharin says:** Gentlemen, not to interject... I understand your frustration. We have been at this for all of our lives. Why are we suddenly expected to over take an enemy that has existed as long as we can remember? Do you have new information about the nature of those caverns? Did you learn something from the spirits?
