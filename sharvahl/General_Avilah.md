>**General Avilah says:** Thank you for delivering this. While I have you here, perhaps you can help. We are in dire need of assistance in the moor. All of the reports from our Taruun are indicating the same thing. The area has to be swept clear of the factions that currently inhabit it. The land itself seems defendable, we need someone to gather some soldiers and clear the area.


>**General Avilah says:** If you accomplish this mission for us, I will be able to reward you for your actions in this leadership role. You will need only to return this box to me to collect your reward and promotion. It will need to contain a grimling chieftain staff, an owlbear guardian talon, a sonic wolf guardian fang, and your Journeyman's Cloak. Good luck to you, should you elect to accept this challenge.
