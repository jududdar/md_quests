# Elder Taruun Ternq

## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** Welcome to the Taruun Scout Building.  May I help you?

**You say:** `training camp`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** The training camp is located on the cliff behind the Royal Palace.  Younger citizens are encouraged to go there if they wish to build their skills and combat proficiency.  Just find the sergeant and sign up.

**You say:** `where.* barrel`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** I know many of the taverns and eateries have their own barrels, but you may want to try Jakhal and Kahala's Brewery.  You can find it in the southwestern section of the Merchant's Quarter, or Corridor of Heroes, as I like to call it.

**You say:** `where.* bank`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** The bank is in the south-easternof the Merchants' Quarter.

**You say:** `where.* merchant.* quarter`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** The Merchants' Quarter lies in the middle of the city just east of the Royal Palace.

**You say:** `where.* food`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** Take a look around.  If you're hungry, just follow your nose... or look around one of the barracks in either the South or North Gate districts.

**You say:** `where.* arena`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** You can find the arena in the east side of the city, but it is rarely used these days.  It stands opposite of the pool in the Merchants' Corridor.

**You say:** `where.* drink`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** If you're looking for a good drink, just look around.  The Taruun tend to frequent Rawlf's Place in the North Gate district of town.  I prefer the busier taverns.  Try the Trail's End just inside the South Gate district.  It is always packed with soldiers moving back and forth to combat.

**You say:** `where.* forge`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** Hmm... I know that the Khala Dun are fond of smithing. Try looking near their barracks in the western section of the North Gate district.  You can use the forge in Barkhem's shop as well. It's in the Merchants' Quarter.

**You say:** `corridor.* hero`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** The Corridor of Heroes is the section of town that houses many of our finest establishments.  That area also houses our arena and Hall of Heroes.  The Corridor of Heroes is also known as the Merchants' Quarter.  I hope that I did not confuse you with the name.  Its proper name stems from the fact that you must have served in combat to act as proprietor of a shop in that area.

**You say:** `hall.* hero`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** The Hall of Heroes was built overlooking the Arena.  The Arena is rarely used these days, but you can almost always find activity in the Hall.  Our greatest leaders and heroes gather there to direct the battle against the Grimling hordes.

**You say:** `where.* pottery`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** Pottery and other Jharin supplies are located in the northeastern section of the Corridor of Heroes.

**You say:** `where.* hollowshade`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** The Hollowshade is the moor located just outside of the North Gate. There have been a lot of grimling attacks around that area. Coupled with deadly owlbears and rhino beetles, you had best not go unprepared for a tough battle.

**You say:** `where.* north gate`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** The North Gate district lies between the Northern Bridge and the inner corridors of our city.  That district houses our many Khala Dun barracks, Officers' quarters, and larger meeting halls.  The North Bridge leads to the Hollowshade Moor.

**You say:** `where.* south gate`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** The South Gate district lies between the Southern Bridge and the inner corridors of our city.  Many of our Scouts, Animists, and Taruun, live in that district. The South Bridge leads to the Shadeweaver's Thicket.

**You say:** `the pit`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** We call the crater that was formed around our city during the Shifting, the Pit.  It is full of all sorts of nasty little creatures.  Veteran guards watch the area closely and use it as a place to train our new recruits.

**You say:** `where.* loom`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** Many of our town's seamstresses and tailors can be found working together on the top floor of the general mercantile.  I'm sure that you can find a loom there.

**You say:** `where.* mercantile`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** The general mercantile can be found on the southern side of the Corridor of Heroes.  Just look for the sign.

**You say:** `royal corridor`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** The area surrounding the Royal Palace is known as the Royal Corridor.

**You say:** `where.* library`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** We have two libraries.  The Library of War History and Related works is located on the southern side of the Royal Corridor and the Library of Spiritual and Natural Studies is located on the northern side.

**You say:** `where.* arrow`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** If you are looking to purchase arrows, perhaps you should check the South Gate district.  The vendors in that area carry goods that appeal to the Taruun and other scouts that live in that district.

**You say:** `guildmaster`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** We have Guildhalls in several areas.  You can find the Khala Dun under the Arena. The Jharin are housed near the stage above the Royal Palace.  The Taruun, Dar Khura, and Khati Sha are housed near each other in under the Royal Palace.

**You say:** `who.* khura`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** The Dar Khura guide us with their wisdom. They are the ones who speak with the spirits and heal our wounds. They are named in honor of Dar Khura who taught us that we were brought here for a purpose.

**You say:** `who.* khati`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** He was a great hero among our people. It was he who learned to speak with the beasts. Khati Sha was the greatest of explorers who brought Acrylia to us. With these mystical stones, we have built our beloved city. Those who walk with the beasts are named in his honor.

**You say:** `who.* khala`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** The Khala Dun are the king's warriors. They are charged with defending the city of Shar Vahl and commanding any offensives necessary. They are named after Khala Dun who was King Vah Kerrath's protector during the times of the shifting. You can find their guild within the Arena Complex in the merchants quarter.

**You say:** `who.* taruun`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** The Taruun bring food for our city. They are among the most cunning of our people. The Taruun watch us and protect us from within the shadows. They are named in honor of Taruun, the lost orphan who lived and flourished among our people despite his shy nature. Taruun taught us the importance of stealth with honor. The location of their guild is in the heart of the city. To find it, you must find the delicate balance between honor and battle.

**You say:** `raja`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** King Raja Kerrath is our beloved and most noble king. He is the son of King Vah Kerrath and the grandson of our most honorable prophet Kejaan.

**You say:** `ragnar`

**You say:** `shifting`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** These were the troubled times when we were ripped from our world and brought to this soil. Our leader and beloved King Vah Kerrath led us to rebuild this great city and so we have taken his name in his honor.

**You say:** `grimling`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** The grimlings are the beings who attack our people around the Acrylia mines. They have the ability to use magic against us. Be careful if you wish to travel north. We have been waging war in that area.

**You say:** `acrylia`



>**Elder Taruun Ternq says:** Acrylia is the magical ore found in the mines to the north. We use this ore to build our homes and weapons. It has been very difficult lately to mine for these stones due to the grimling attacks on our miners.
