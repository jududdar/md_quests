# Jhimis Khadwi


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Jhimis Khadwi says:** Welcome to my store! How may I help you?

**You say:** `stretching dowels`



>**Jhimis Khadwi says:** Aye, I have a few left, but they are a big seller right now and I don't know when I'm going to get more in stock. Perhaps we can barter for a set. If you can gather two small owlbear claws and show me your apprentice's cloak, I'll guess that I can justify given you a set of dowels. I'll also be able to make some earrings for my girlfriend. I'm sure she'll love that!

>**Jhimis Khadwi says:** 'These claws are very nice! Don't you think they will make splendid earrings? Of course you do! Well, she'd better like them after all of the trouble I had to go through to get them. Here are your dowels. If you need more, I'll have a new crate of them tomorrow. Take care and enjoy...
