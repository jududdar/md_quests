**You say:** `hail`



>**Jhimis Khadwi says:** Welcome to my store! How may I help you?

**You say:** `stretching dowels`



>**Jhimis Khadwi says:** Aye, I have a few left, but they are a big seller right now and I don't know when I'm going to get more in stock. Perhaps we can barter for a set. If you can gather two small owlbear claws and show me your apprentice's cloak, I'll guess that I can justify given you a set of dowels. I'll also be able to make some earrings for my girlfriend. I'm sure she'll love that!
