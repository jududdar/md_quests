# Cook Mylis



## Dialog

**You say:** `spicy fish stew`



>**Cook Mylis says:** Ohhh, I love fish stew and it's fairly simple to make. If you're looking to make a large pot of it, you'll want to be sure that you have enough ingredients ready from the start. Gather up a flask of water, a jug of sauce, some spices and two wetfang steaks. Cook them in an oven in a large stewing pot. For being so foul, those wetfangs sure taste good. Throw all of that in to simmer for a bit and you're ready to go.
