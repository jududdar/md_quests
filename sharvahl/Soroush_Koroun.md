# Soroush Koroun


## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Soroush Koroun says:** Greetings to you. Soandso.  I have just returned from another trip to Katta Castellum and am trying to organize my notes. I apologize that I've little time to talk.  Everything happened so suddenly what with the odd circumstances surrounding the last diplomat. I have not quite had time to get used to my new post.

**You say:** `behari`



>*Soroush Koroun pauses to find the right words, 'Behari, the last to hold this post, disappeared on his last trip to Katta. He was a friend of mine for some time, I never dreamed that I would have to undertake his duties in this way. I believe that I was the last to see him alive. His behavior at the time seemed peculiar, but I shrugged it off as simply a man blissfully in love,' he says with a heavy sigh, and adds somberly, 'I was very happy for him.'*

**You say:** `behavior`



if( **Faction is** > Indifferent) then



>**Soroush Koroun says:** I never mentioned this to Kalila, I thought it would hurt her more than it would help, but when I bumped into Behari just before he disappeared, he was going on and on about a love potion of some sort. He was very excited, said he thought it would be the perfect gift for Kalila on their wedding night, so you see why I never mentioned it. Anyway, he said that he had just gathered all of the ingredients and was heading back out of Katta.

>**Soroush Koroun says:** I am not sure that I should discuss this matter any further, I hope that you understand.


**You say:** `love potion`



>**Soroush Koroun says:** I have no idea what he meant by a 'love potion.' I have never even heard of such a thing, it just isn't my field, I am afraid. Maybe one of the spiritists knows something about it. I doubt that it will do anything to help you track down Behari, but I wish you luck my friend.
