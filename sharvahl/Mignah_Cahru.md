## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Mignah Cahru says:** Hello, Soandso. I am Mignah, a humble acrylia specialist. If you have a form of acrylia that merchants will not buy please hand it to me and I will pay you whatever it may be worth.

**You say:** `acrylia slate`



>*Mignah Cahru pulls a smoldering piece of forged acrylia from a nearby oven and, before you can react, presses your hand into the still soft metal. 'This may hurt a bit, but it'll heal.' He then etches your name and the date into the slate and plunges it into a bucket of water before placing it into your stinging palm.*
