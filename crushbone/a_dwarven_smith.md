## Dialog

**You say:** `ringmail`



>**a dwarven smith says:** The king was the last person I heard of who was wearing what sounded like my ringmail. Return it to me and I will reward you with a fine weapon I forged myself.

**You say:** `interest`



>**a dwarven smith says:** Okay, then! The first item you can get back for me is my brass shield. Up on that hill, over where the trainees practice, there is usually an instructor. Last time I saw my shield, it was in the hands of one of those blasted lackeys. Bring it back to me!
