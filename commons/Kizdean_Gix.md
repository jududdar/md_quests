**You say:** `thex mallet`



>**Kizdean Gix says:** The Thex Mallet is a very special weapon of elven creation. It is as ancient as Norrath itself. Queen Cristanos commands that we find it and return it to Loveal S'nez. That is all you need to know.

**You say:** `utalk adarev otcin`



>**Kizdean Gix says:** You speak the words of the Dead. You must be the assistance Loveal was to send. You must work quickly! Inside Befallen are the three pieces to the [Thex Mallet] which are to be returned to Loveal. Find Hubard L'rodd. He was my assistant. Give him this note and he should have information.
