>**Furball Miller says:** <BARK!>  Hiya!  <Bark!>  <Bark!>  My name is Furball Miller.  I work here on my father's farm.  Of course, he is not my real [father] but he is the one who raised me from a pup.  I hope to go back to [Blackburrow] some day and try to get them to stop all the senseless fighting with the humans of Qeynos.

**You say:** `blackburrow`



>**Furball Miller says:** Blackburrow is home to a clan of gnolls called the Sabertooths.  It is where I am from but I really don't ever remember being there.  Pa tells me the gnolls there are always fighting with the <BARK!>  humans of Qeynos.  I wish they would stop and realize that humans and gnolls are not as different as they like to think.  <BARK!>
