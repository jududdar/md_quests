## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Einhorst McMannus says:** Greetings, Soandso. Welcome to the fishing village of Clan McMannus. We sell what we can here.  Have a look around but, please do not buy too much. We must save most of our stock for delivery to [our home].

**You say:** `home`



>**Einhorst McMannus says:** We come from the frozen walls of [Halas]. We were sent here by the council of elders to set up this village. We support Halas by shipping what we catch and sending them items which cannot be found in Everfrost Peaks. We presently have a shipment of [lion meat] for [delivery] to Halas.

**You say:** `halas`





>**Einhorst McMannus says:** Halas is the mighty city of the barbarians of the North. It lies among the Everfrost Peaks.

**You say:** `searching for the fugitive`



>**Einhorst McMannus says:** I see they have sent someone to hunt the scoundrel down. I am afraid I haven't seen the barbarian thief in quite some time. You can search and search for him here in the western plains, but I doubt you shall find him. Good luck.

**You say:** `delivery`



>**Einhorst McMannus says:** Oh, yes, the lion meat shipment. Aye, it's here somewhere. Just a moment. Ah! Here you go. Apologize for the delay in this.


**You receive:**  [Lion Meat Shipment](/item/13961)


**You say:** `lion meat`



>**Einhorst McMannus says:** That would be splendid! Go to Misla and tell her you will deliver the lion meat to Halas. She will instruct you. Thank you, my friend.

**You say:** `frostbite`



>**Einhorst McMannus says:** Frostbite is our trusty wolf. We found him as a pup.

**You say:** `wolves of the north`





>**Einhorst McMannus says:** The Wolves of the North are the barbarian warriors of Halas. All of us in Clan McMannus are members. Mess with us and you mess with the Wolves of the North.

**You say:** `helsa`




>**Einhorst McMannus says:** My wife? She is dead. Crushed by the hands of a foul cyclops. I wish I could find that cyclops. I would pay greatly for his eye. I have slain every giant I could find, but I have not met him. I could still remember that cry of his...  BROOON!
