# Maldin the Old
## Dialog

**You say:** `follower of karana`



>**Maldin the Old says:** Yes. I am a follower of Karana, the Rainkeeper. It is He who keeps the plains fertile.

**You say:** `blessing`



>**Maldin the Old says:** Of the things I desire, I can think of nothing I wish for more than the blessings of Karana. By drinking from the temple chalice of a Karana cleric I can attain this.

**You say:** `karana bandit`



>**Maldin the Old says:** The Karana bandits are rogues who operate in the plains. I have heard there are bounties for the bandits. Within the Temple of Thunder in Qeynos, Cleric Gehna offers one for bandit spectacles and Paladin Chesgard offers one for bandit sashes.
