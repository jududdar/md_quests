**You say:** `hail`



>*Chrislin Baker slowly lifts her head.'Have you brought any writing materials for me? The last few supplies I had were stolen.'*

**You say:** `writing materials`



>**Chrislin Baker says:** A passing illusionist gave me some enchanted writing materials. He said they would help inspire me to capture my mind's images on paper. If you would just be so kind as to bring me plain old paper and a quill from Qeynos, I can get back to writing.

**You say:** `paper`



>**Chrislin Baker says:** I don't know who might be selling those these days. Just ask around. I am sure someone will know.
