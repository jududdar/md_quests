# Minda


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Minda says:** Hello. Nice to make your acquaintance. Be careful in the plains. There are many creatures. Just stay close to the guard towers.

**You say:** `follower of karana`



>**Minda says:** Yes. I am a follower of Karana, the Rainkeeper. It is He who keeps the plains fertile.

**You say:** `blessing`



>**Minda says:** Of the things I desire, I can think of nothing I wish for more than the blessings of Karana. By drinking from the temple chalice of a Karana cleric I can attain this.

**You say:** `karana bandit`



>**Minda says:** The Karana bandits are rogues who operate in the plains. I have heard there are bounties for the bandits. Within the Temple of Thunder in Qeynos, Cleric Gehna offers one for bandit spectacles and Paladin Chesgard offers one for bandit sashes.
