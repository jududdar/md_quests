>**Brother Chintle says:** You speak of the spawn of all disease.  Seek no more knowledge of this evil lord.  Know only that his way can lead only to eternal damnation.

**You say:** `trintle`



>**Brother Chintle says:** Brother Trintle is a member of my order, the Priests of Life.  I take his watch from time to time.  The last I saw of him, he was met by some lady named Nomaria Dosenar.  She appeared to be a cleric of some kind, but I have never seen her in Qeynos.  Perhaps she is new to the Knights of Thunder.

**You say:** `estle`



>**Brother Chintle says:** Brother Estle spends most of his time at the merchant's homestead opposite this tree.  He is one of the young acolytes sent by the Temple of Life to assist the residents of the plains, as am I.
