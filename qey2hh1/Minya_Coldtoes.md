# Minya Coldtoes
## Dialog

**You say:** `follower of Karana`



>**Minya Coldtoes says:** Yes. I am a follower of Karana, the Rainkeeper. It is He who keeps the plains fertile.

**You say:** `blanket`



>**Minya Coldtoes says:** With the frequent rains, I find my only need is a blanket to keep me warm during the long cold nights. Thank Karana the temple has begun to send young paladins to deliver extra blankets.

**You say:** `karana bandit`



>**Minya Coldtoes says:** The Karana bandits are rogues who operate in the plains. I have heard there are bounties for the bandits. Within the Temple of Thunder in Qeynos, Cleric Gehna offers one for bandit spectacles and Paladin Chesgard offers one for bandit sashes.
