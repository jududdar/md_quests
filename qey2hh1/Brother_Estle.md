## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Brother Estle says:** Greetings, child of life. The way of the [Prime Healer] shall set you free and cleanse your soul. I hope to see you at [mass].

**You say:** `prime healer`



>**Brother Estle says:** Rodcet Nife is the Prime Healer. His way is the path of healing and life. There can be no true life until your soul is healed by healing others. This will take you into the eternal when your time comes.

## Turn-Ins




if **You turn in:** [Blessed Oil Flask](/item/13910)


>**Brother Estle says:** Thank you. Now I may cleanse the bodies of the new converts and help them enter into a new life. I also have this. It was given to me by a dying gnoll of all things. They belong to Brother Hayle. The gnoll's last words were 'Free him.' Make sure High Priestess Jahnda gets this. Be swift!
