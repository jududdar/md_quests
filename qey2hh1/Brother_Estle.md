## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Brother Estle says:** Greetings, child of life. The way of the [Prime Healer] shall set you free and cleanse your soul. I hope to see you at [mass].

**You say:** `prime healer`



>**Brother Estle says:** Rodcet Nife is the Prime Healer. His way is the path of healing and life. There can be no true life until your soul is healed by healing others. This will take you into the eternal when your time comes.

**You say:** `mass`



>**Brother Estle says:** Mass is not being held out here as yet. I am waiting for the [blessed oil] from the Temple of Life. You may attend services there.

**You say:** `blessed oil`
