He even snatched his Grandmaster's Vial! Master Hanns was so furious he grabbed one of his old blades from his collection and jabbed it at the wall so hard it shattered! I really need some help replacing all that was [ruined] or I have a feeling Master Hanns is going to send me on a suicide mission!
