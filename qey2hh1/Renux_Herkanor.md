>**Renux Herkanor says:** Master Hanns is going to kill me! I let that dark assassin look at his prized poison collection and he lifted it all when I wasn't looking! He even snatched his Grandmaster's Vial! Master Hanns was so furious he grabbed one of his old blades from his collection and jabbed it at the wall so hard it shattered! I really need some help replacing all that was [ruined] or I have a feeling Master Hanns is going to send me on a suicide mission!


**You say:** `ruined`




>**Renux Herkanor says:** Fantastic! I need to replace all those old poisons, the vial and that old scareling blade. I think the bottles had the following written on them Bane, Burn, Essence, Sloth, Rage, Swiftness, Disorientation, and Dimethyl. Please hurry!

>**Renux Herkanor says:** Great! Looks like everything is here! Hopefully Master Hanns won't send me to Steamfront now, I have a really bad feeling about that assignment. Here take this Seal, it was dropped by that dark stranger. It glows with a dark power I just don't understand. Be wary of further sightings of that dark assassin.
