# Linaya Sowlin









## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Linaya Sowlin says:** Greetings!  It is always nice to meet another traveler.  The roads of the Plains of Karana are heavily trodden, but sparsely patrolled.  Be careful of bandits and especially of giants.  I have seen a few since my [move from the Jaggedpine].

**You say:** `note`



>**Linaya Sowlin says:** The note spoke of the [Unkempt Druids]. I did not get a chance to read it all, only a glimpse. Perhaps the man still has the note. Too bad. I am sure Gerael Woodone of the druids of Surefall Glade should look at it.

**You say:** `unkempt druids`



>**Linaya Sowlin says:** The Unkempt Druids are a crazed group of druids and rangers. I learned of them when I was in the Jaggedpine. They are a secret group and aim to keep it that way. They would kill anyone who learned of their whereabouts.

**You say:** `move from the jaggedpine`



>**Linaya Sowlin says:** I inherited this farmhouse from my late uncle so I left the Jaggedpine to live here.  The Jaggedpine is a beautiful forest but I believe my skills as a druid may come in handy as a farmer.

## Turn-Ins




if( **You turn in:** [Flask of Nitrates](/item/13945)) then


>**Linaya Sowlin says:** Oh thank Tunare you showed up when you did. I was at a nearby merchant house when a fellow dropped a [note] and I picked it up and read it. It talked of the [Unkempt Druids] and before I could read on, the man swiped it from my hands. I ran for dear life, for surely he would kill me for reading the note. I think I lost him in the woods but I am not sure. Please stay with me a while to be sure.
