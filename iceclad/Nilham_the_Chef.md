# Nilham the Chef
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Nilham the Chef says:** Ahoy, Soandso. Welcome ta the brig. I didn't get ta the 'B' section of my piratisms manual so I'm not sure what a brig is but I'm guessin' it means 'really small place without enough food or water.' So, ya here ta stay or just visitin'?

**You say:** `cat`



>**Nilham the Chef says:** That was a nasty cat.  I dun think it was after us, though. I think it just smelled the fresh chunk of wooly rhino jerky I had.  It didn't do anythin' but knock us over.  I guess that's what it likes, walrus.  After it knocked us over it slipped away towards the bridge island like a ghostly mist.  I'm thinkin' I saw a glimmer in its maw while it was runnin' off.

**You say:** `crate`



>**Nilham the Chef says:** I'll be an aft port if I think anyone will ever see the crate and key again. If by some act o' Prexus you do, then take them ta the Cap'n. I'm sure he'd be thrilled to see it. Just don't remind him I'm here cause he might let me go and make me work again.



**You say:** `stay`



>*Nilham the Chef grins.  'Not sure what ya did ta have ta stay but take a seat.  There's a good starin' wall right over there.  Don't hurt yerself with excitement.*


**You say:** `piratism`



>**Nilham the Chef says:** Aye.  We all got a pirate grammar manual from the good cap'n.  We were supposed ta learn how ta talk like proper pirates from all the books Cap'n Nalot read but I never had time cause I used ta be the cook and was too busy.  That's really the only bad thing about this brig thing really.


**You say:** `bad thing`



>**Nilham the Chef says:** I don't have anythin' ta read.  No books here at all.  I don't mind bein kept in here cause I don't have ta cook or work anymore but it'd be great ta have somethin' ta read.  I still wanna learn more words.

**You say:** `learn more words`



>**Nilham the Chef says:** That's how we decide who gets ta do what.  Who can use the most pirate words.  Cause I only got to the 'A' section of the book, I'm pretty low on the list.  Thats why I'm the chef.  I can only say things like 'Arrr', 'Avast yer afts' and 'Ahoy those afts!'.
