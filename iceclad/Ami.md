## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>*Ami flips through a few pages of a small book, reading intently before answering you. 'Ye scurvy dog. I'll strike yer colors 'fore ya can put me on a gibbet. Take that, ya crimp!' She flips through a few more pages then smiles at you. 'Arrrr!'*
 
**You say:** `scurvy dog`



>**Ami says:** Hey, that's pretty good. You did it without a book too. Nice to meet you. I'm the bosun here.

**You say:** `bosun`



>**Ami says:** Yup. I think it means I'm in charge of the flag cause that's what the Cap'n told me to take care of. I'm the one who made our symbol, so I get to protect it. I even got my own copy of the grammar manual so I can practice my pirate speech.


**You say:** `grammar manual`



>*Ami nods and shows you the book for a moment. 'We don't have many of them and usually we share. My book is missing a chapter, though.'*

**You say:** `chapter`



>*Ami nods. 'A mate of mine borrowed the P Chapter to draw a map on but then he went and got himself lost. I've memorized the rest of the book but that chapter. Oh, well, I guess I can get by with what I have. Walk the mizenmast and batten down the boom!' She looks at you proudly. 'Good, eh? I'm one of the best pirates we have.'*
end
