**You say:** `hail`



>**Dannis Faleet says:** Welcome to the Fortune's Fancy. Soandso!  I carry only the finest jewels and jewelry in all the land.  All of the [charges and accusations] made against me are obviously false. as you can see by my beautiful wares.

**You say:** `charges`



>**Dannis Faleet says:** Bah!  Some of the, ehem, fine residents of this city have accused me of replacing precious gems with glass.  They have even gone so far as to say that I shortchange people.  The nerve!  It is good that so many [people] require my services.

**You say:** `people`



>**Dannis Faleet says:** Well, you see, as I am the only jeweler in this fine city, I am required to render service to the palace, all the guild houses and all of the fine citizens here.  Between you and me, I think that's the only reason I am still around.
