## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>*Tatalros the Cruel releases a low, guttural hiss, of unearthly power and fearsome ringing that echoes off the very walls of the city. 'Greetings, Erudite. It has been some time since I had the pleasure of seeing one of living flesh not cower and bleed from their very eyes at the mere sight of me. I shall not take it as an insult this time, as all things change and adapt. I assume that merely my name, which alone once caused fear and strife within the soul of any who heard it, has fallen from the pages of history. No matter, in time that shall be changed.*
