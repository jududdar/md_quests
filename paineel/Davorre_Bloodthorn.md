## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then



>**Davorre Bloodthorn says:** Greetings. Perhaps within that husk you call a body there is some worth? Are you [experienced] in your craft, young one, or are you a [neonate]?


elseif **Faction** >= Indifferent then



>**Davorre Bloodthorn says:** You need to prove your dedication to our cause before I can discuss such matters with you.


else



**Davorre Bloodthorn says one of the following:**

>I didn't know Slime could speak common.  Go back to the sewer before I lose my temper.

>Is that your BREATH, or did something die in here?  Now go away!

>I wonder how much I could get for the tongue of a blithering fool?  Leave before I decide to find out for myself.

>Oh look..a talking lump of refuse..how novel!


**You say:** `neonate`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then



>**Davorre Bloodthorn says:** Well then, child, I may still have a task for you. Will you [make use of your pathetic cowardice], then, eh?

>**Davorre Bloodthorn says:** I see. This will not be the first time for you, I am sure. Take this list to Auhrik Siet\`ka. His writing has become illegible in his old age, but he shall clarify what it is he needs you to do. Do as he says, child, and perhaps you will prove yourself a bit more worthy than the rotting flesh he will most likely have you return to him.

>**Davorre Bloodthorn says:** Ahhhh, a youth doth approach me with such confidence! That is to be commended in and of itself. Ordinarily, I would turn you away without a second glance, but perhaps you can be of some use. Tell me, child, are you [willing to assist] me in a small, yet important, task?

>**Davorre Bloodthorn says:** Good, child. Deliver this note to Veisha Fathomwalker. You shall find her patrolling the outer regions of Toxxulia Forest. I trust that you will keep your eyes to yourself in this matter. Now go, and please travel within the veil of night, so you will not be seen by those whose minds are still clouded with delusions of Erudin's grandeur.
