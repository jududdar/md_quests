## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Elia Athrex says:** Hello.  Do you need something or did you merely wish to grace me with your oh-so-delightfully perfumed breath?

**You say:** `cold`



>**Elia Athrex says:** Who are you?  Bah.  Never mind.  The cold of lost souls chilling the spine.  Once this was Azrax Soulstealer's domain.  A crueler man there never was.  Binding and stealing souls was his forte.  Some of the souls he reaped still dwell in this place, seeking the promise of release fom their eternal suffering.

**You say:** `suffering`



>**Elia Athrex says:** Let them suffer, I say!  I just wish they wouldn't chill my spine.
