**You say:** `Hail`



>**Taria Clayspinner says:** Hello. Soandso.  I make the finest statuettes in all the land.  Each one depicts a power on Norrath.  I have some of the most realistic and lifelike statues.  I only take [special orders] as they are rather time-consuming to make.

**You say:** `what special orders`



>**Taria Clayspinner says:** Well, if you must know, many priests and devout worshipers of Cazic-Thule purchase my statues and pray over them.  I have made many other statuettes of the gods just to practice, on the off chance that a worshiper of another faith might care to order one from me.
