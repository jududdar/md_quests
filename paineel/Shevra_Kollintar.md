# Shevra Kollintar
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Shevra Kollintar says:** Unless you intend to [make yourself useful], do not bother me.  I await the return of our Lord, Cazic-Thule.  He comes, and I shall be the first to greet Him.  I will train you, if need be, for He looks upon those who aid Him kindly.  If you are not here for training, return to your meditations or bother someone else.

**You say:** `make myself useful`



>**Shevra Kollintar says:** One of our spies has reported a sighting of Malik Zaren, a courier of [the High Council].  He was seen resting at an inn called 'Golden Roosters' in High Pass Hold and is en route to Erudin Palace. He may be carrying a message containing information of great value to us.  Hunt him down and return to me with the letter he carries. I will reward you for this task.

**You say:** `high council`



>**Shevra Kollintar says:** The High Council is the governing board of Erudin, our sworn enemies.  Beware of these types, they will not look upon you warmly.
