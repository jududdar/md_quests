>**Evus Doracmal says:** Good day. Soandso!  Have you visited Taria already? Taria does indeed make some of the finest statuettes in all the land.  I fear. though. that she has lost her faith.  She used to make idols depicting our Lord of Fear.  Now she dabbles in the creation of [other idols]!

**You say:** `other idol`



>**Evus Doracmal says:** Well. just the other day. she was commissioned to create a representation of Tunare for Iva down at the Bakery.  I've always known that Iva was a bit odd. but that is just downright strange!
