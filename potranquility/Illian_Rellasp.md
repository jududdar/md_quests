## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Illian Rellasp says:** Hello, Soandso.  Come to enjoy the soothing serenity of this place?  The quiet waters remind me of the docks in Erudin when I was a child.  It is unfortunate that the tranquility of Quellious does not extend further into the world of Norrath.  Every Deepwater Knight yearns for the eternal calm of paradise after a life of faithful service to the gods.  Perhaps you have heard of one such knight that achieved transcendence.  His name was [Inte Akera] and he is one of the greatest Deepwater Knights to ever live.
