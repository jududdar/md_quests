>**Dorn B-Dynn says:** So, business is your mission! I have never met you. Who sent you?

**You say:** `shelter`



>**Dorn B-Dynn says:** Then look elsewhere! You are lucky your head still sits upon your shoulders. The dervish cutthroats are not fond of strangers. Now, leave!

**You say:** `Zimbittle sent me`



>**Dorn B-Dynn says:** I do not know if I could trust you. You certainly do not look as though you are from Grobb, although your stench does hint of that place. If you are truly sent by Zimbittle, what is the passwrod?

**You say:** `Mukk`

>**Dorn B-Dynn says:** So you were sent by Zimbittle. Take this note Kraagia of Da Bashers in Grobb. Do not lose the note. If it were to fall into the wrong hands of [Goonda], this whole plan could be disrupted. Now, leave, I can no longer tolerate you foul stench!
