## Dialog

>*Guardian Ionew does not seem to budge or take notice of your presence. The gargoyle remains still and absolute in its poise, ignoring your presence and voice entirely. You notice the shackles bound to its limbs, binding them together by a two-foot length of chain. The creature is a prisoner, but is inanimate. A brief sense of intrigue, curiosity, and a slight fear fills you as you realize that not only those who hold spirits are subject to the Tribunal's judgment.*
