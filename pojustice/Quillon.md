## Dialog

>*Quillon remains stiff and lifeless in its posture. The gargoyle creature's eyes suddenly catch you off-guard as they open to look upon you. Hate and spite is draped over you by the crimson orbs of the gargoyle's gaze. Without a word or sound, the creature returns to its lifeless stance, ignoring your presence further.*
