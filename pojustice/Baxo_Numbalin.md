# Baxo Numbalin







## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>*Baxo Numbalin furrows his brow and sighs heavily, his grief and boredom more than apparent. The gnome looks up at you with deadened eyes and a veil of unfathomable sadness. He opens his mouth as if to speak, but remains silent and turns away, staring once more upon the unvarnished walls of his cell.*
