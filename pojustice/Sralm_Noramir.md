# Sralm Noramir


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>*Sralm Noramir pounces at you, grabbing you by your throat. 'What are you doing here? Who sent you?'*

**You say:** `no one.* sent me`



>**Sralm Noramir says:** I hope you are not here to free a prisoner. The Tribunal punishes such actions harshly. Once here there is no hope of escape. Even for one such as I.

**You say:** `.* sent me`



>**Sralm Noramir says:** Hmm, that name is not familiar to me.  You must be in the wrong place.  Begone before I wear your hide to keep myself warm.



**You say:** `such as i`



>**Sralm Noramir says:** Ahh, how rude of me. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Sralm Noramir, warrior by birth thief by choice.

**You say:** `thief`



>**Sralm Noramir says:** Aye, I could steal the sword from a warriors hands or a kiss from a ladys lips. Ever hear of Emperor Sllanar?

**You say:** `Emperor Sllanar`



>**Sralm Noramir says:** He was the ruler of Sebilis, for a short time.  It does not surprise me that you have not heard of him.  His rule was not long, and he did little good or bad for the iksar.  He was, however, quite [wealthy].

**You say:** `wealthy`



>**Sralm Noramir says:** Quite wealthy, indeed.  More money than you could ever imagine, but it was just as much as I could imagine.  I felt that the good Emperor had more wealth than he could possibly ever spend, so I thought it was my duty to [relieve] him of some of the excess.

**You say:** `emperor`



>**Sralm Noramir says:** You see, generally thieves were imprisoned, or at worst executed, but banishment here was usually reserved to those who committed heinous crimes.  I guess you should be careful when you rob the person who gets to decide on the definition of heinous.  Have you any news of [Sebilis]?

**You say:** `relieve`



>**Sralm Noramir says:** Yes, and quite a job it was.  He kept all of his accumulated wealth in caves deep below the city.  Though they were well guarded, it was nothing for one such as myself.  I will not bore you with details, but the short of it is I made off with a king's ransom... Literally.  Unfortunately, I was [caught].

**You say:** `caught`



>*Sralm Noramir sighs, 'It seems the good Emperor was quite paranoid, and took precautions against this contingency.  All of his wealth was enchanted by a tracking spell.  It was silly of me not to look for it.  Stealing was a minor crime in Sebilis, but stealing from the [Emperor] was another issue all its own.'*

**You say:** `Sebilis`



>**Sralm Noramir says:** Sebilis is the city of the Iksar.  The greatest city on all of Kunark, and was my home at one time.  I guess no news is good news.

**You say:** `trakanon.* dragon`



>**Sralm Noramir says:** A dragon in Sebilis!  Stop your foul lies. Your humor does not suit my tastes.

**You say:** `who am i`



>**Sralm Noramir says:** Well, assuming the question is as silly as it sounds, you are Soandso.
