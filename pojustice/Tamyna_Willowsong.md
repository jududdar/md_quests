## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>*Tamyna Willowsong gives a solemn nod in recognition of Soandso, though her features are wrought with an unfathomable sorrow, 'Shhh, friend. The prisoners are not to speak here. If we are caught, we will be placed in solitary confinement, and I do not think that I would be able to endure that torment again. Nevertheless, your presence is comforting. It has been a long time since I have had another show any interest in me.' The Feir'Dal's face gains a strange light of wonder for a moment, 'Perhaps you would wish to hear my tale and grant a brief moment of release from this torture?*

**You say:** `hear your tale`



>*Tamyna Willowsong smiles gently, though the sorrow on her features almost sting at your heart, 'I'm grateful for it, friend. I was not always a prisoner and was once a being of good heart and faith. A bard of Erollisi Marr, I traveled Norrath in hopes of spreading joy and hope to all of its citizens. During my travels, my own heart was graced with Erollisi's passions in a most unfortunate and tragic circumstance.*

**You say:** `circumstance`



>**Tamyna Willowsong says:** I was visiting the city of Freeport, delivering one of my many tales to the people in the Theatre of the Tranquil. As I finished my tale, the most handsome man I had ever seen approached me. He gave praise to my tale and song and offered to walk with me a while through the Commonlands beyond. He claimed that he was enchanted and could not rest the night without being witness to my talents further, for my tales and voice struck his heart and spirit like no other. I was immediately enchanted with the half-elven gentleman and took his hand. Seemingly, it was a joyful man that led me through the calm Commonlands. I serenaded him with my lute and voice, all the while giving the glorious tales of Norrath's most notable legends. When the night turned to dawn and the sands of Ro were at our feet, he returned me to the city and our company parted at the bard's guild that housed me throughout my stay there. This meeting would change my life.'

**You say:** `life`



e.self:Say("The handsome man, who revealed his name to me as Tarraul, returned for each of my shows and each night for the three weeks that I remained in Freeport, we spent together. I had fallen in love with the man 

**You say:** `choice`



e.self:Say("Tarraul requested that I forfeit my place amongst the sister of Erollisi and join him solely in the city of Freeport. He claimed that he could not bear to be without me, should I be his bride, and that my dedication to the sisters would have us in needless separation. I asked if he would join me on my ventures around Norrath, but he declined, for Freeport was his home and his obligations resided there. I returned to the isle of Erollisi without an answer to my love's question. For a week I sat in thought and wonder, questioning my faith for the first time. How could I be given this gift of love 

**You say:** `decision`



>**Tamyna Willowsong says:** I found Erollisi to be a cruel goddess whose followers were naive. I could not understand how the goddess of love would place one of her followers on a path of choice between the two guiding passions in their lives. I left the isle in fury, rudely denouncing my faith in the Queen of Love and forever removing myself from the order. I returned to Freeport and my love that eve. We were married the following week in a small, private ceremony performed by one of Tarraul's dear friends. It wouldn't be for another three years before I would discover exactly what I had done.

**You say:** `done`



e.self:Say("One eve, a knock came upon our door. Tarraul and a fellow merchant were occupied at the time, engaged in affairs of business. I answered the door and to my surprise, two paladins from the Temple of Marr were at our door. They exclaimed that they wished to speak with my husband. Surprised and confused, I allowed them in and questioned their reasoning for coming to our home so late. They looked upon me with pity and expressed their remorse in having to reveal the truth of my husband to me in this fashion, but they had no choice. I was so confused and demanded to know why they were in my home. Tarraul had come down the stairs and the knights, pushing me aside, drew their blades and ordered that he go with them. My husband looked at me, a sly grin upon his face 

**You say:** `truth`



e.self:Say("My husband did something I had not thought him capable of in the past 

**You say:** `answer`



e.self:Say("I asked him why the paladins sought him and why his reaction was so brash and violent. He smirked at this and revealed something that should have torn me a part then, but had no effect. The half-elven man I had known for three years disappeared and in his wake, stood a Teir'Dal. He was an enchanter and an aid to the Dismal Rage and Sir Lucan D'Lere. He said he was proud of me, that the actions I was so quick to perform had surprised and intrigued him most deeply. I loved him still, for I cared not what race he was
