>*Dremekal snorts and glares down upon you, his human-like eyes blazing with contempt, 'How dare you approach and speak with us! Do you think that in this place, our bias toward you has fallen? Do you believe that we are creatures whose convictions have changed to allow recognition, let alone camaraderie to your kind? We are not as desperate and easy to break as the children of the gods that have been confined to this place. Our tales are for the judgment of the Tribunal and them alone! Begone from this place! Seek out your own kind who dwell to the north! They may have the tales of woe and tragedy that your kind disgustingly amuse yourselves with.'*
