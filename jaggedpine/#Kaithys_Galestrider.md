>*Kaithys Galestrider closes his eyes and gives a mid-bow of his head toward you. 'Greetings, traveler. It is an honor to be reunited with our kindred of the outside world of Norrath, and a great pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am Kaithys Galestrider, citizen and formerly one of many dedicated protectors of the Jaggedpine. Alas, the cycle of life has grown gray in this once vibrant body. Aaaah. . . but do not think that my spirit has grown weary as this body, dear child. I still retain a will of iron and my wisdom has only strengthened with the passing of time. [I still hold a great knowledge] unique to this old mind and my dedication toward this forest and our people is quite strong yet. Do not underestimate the power of sheer will, child, for it can be more cunning and deadly than even the sharpest of blades wielded by the mightiest of warriors.'*



**You say:** `great knowledge`





e.self:Emote("gives a brief grumble and harshly clears his throat before speaking in his rough, strong voice, 'All citizens of the Throne of Karana's Thunder will learn to uphold an artisan skill of some sort when they come of age. This is the necessity of those of us who have lived for so long in solitude 



**You say:** `greater threat`





e.self:Say("One of the items stolen in the recent raids was a priceless and sacred tome 



**You say:** `threat`





>*Kaithys Galestrider clears his throat and makes a motion with his strong arm toward the west, 'The gnolls of Blackburrow dug their way to our forest. Their reasons are apparently 'holy' ones for their kind as they were in search of the ancient shrine of Brell Serilis that was built by the dwarves in secrecy. . . how many years ago I am not certain of. Where the dwarves went and why, again I don't know. In any case, these 'questors' of their earthen deity have taken it upon themselves to make routine attacks on our home. I suppose they feel that if the shrine is now theirs, that the forest above should as well be their personal playing ground. Not that we care so much if the gnolls wish to pay homage to their god, mind you, but their intrusion here is far beyond a nuisance and inconvenience for with them came much more worrisome [turmoil].'*



**You say:** `turmoil`





e.self:Say("Much more has come through the gnoll-dug tunnel than the gnolls and their attacks upon our home. The vile criminals of your world have followed the gnolls' heels and infected our land with their greedy lusts for wealth. It seems that one cannot walk the forest without finding a rotting, half-skinned corpse of one of our sacred beasts anymore. They kill for profit 



**You say:** `interest`





e.self:Say("As I have already said, the poachers seek profit, wealth, and infamy among the goodly citizens of your world 



**You say:** `report`





e.self:Emote("sighs and shakes his head in further display of his disappointment, 'It seems that the Tome of Thunder was something commissioned to be stolen 



**You say:** `group`





e.self:Say("The scout believes them to be a cult of militant, brutal, and viscous so-called druids and rangers who have resided in the planes of Karana and the Mountains of Rathe for decades now. This group calls themselves the Unkempt Druids 



**You say:** `troubling`





e.self:Emote("coughs hard for a moment and then clears his throat, the old mans attentions clearly caught off-guard and his eyes wide with surprise, 'Why is this troubling, you ask?! Any who serves nature 



**You say:** `philosophies`





e.self:Say("To be honest, we know very little about the unkempt as they are not ones to openly share their ways with outsiders in the civil manner of words. What we do know, however, is that where we try to accept and teach all who would lend ear the importance of the natural world 



**You say:** `leave their woods`





>**Kaithys Galestrider says:** We are not certain, but I believe that they are content where they lay. The true unkempt do not show the desire to convert the other orders dedicated to the preservation of nature to their ways through any mass scale mission. Much of this recluse nature is likely a result of the strong influence of the Tribes of the Dawn and the Moon. To be honest, the barricades keeping the unkempt sealed from the Jaggedpine were set in-place with the desire to keep our young, curious, and strong-headed rangers and druids from venturing into the territory. There was also an element of desire to keep the inhabitants of the forest there, for although they may not seem the missionary types, figuratively speaking of course, their ways may very well escape the confines of the Unkempt Wood and many thirsty and curious young druids and rangers might find themselves seduced by the allure and mystery of the Unkempt ways. Unfortunately, it seems that our efforts have [proven to be in vain].



**You say:** `proven to be in vain`





e.self:Say("If what the scout of the glade says is true and the presence of unkempt cultists is indeed a reality then somehow the philosophies or some semblance of them have leaked out into the world. I sincerely doubt that their naming convention is but a coincidence. The true unkempt pay homage to the Mother of All exclusively, although they do so not within the traditional methods of worship and reverence. From what we have gathered, they view her as a spiritual manifestation of the cycle and balance of the natural world 



**You say:** `return the tome`





e.self:Emote("furrows his heavy, wrinkled brow as he carefully studies you, 'If you believe you can brave such an endeavor, child, then I am willing to accept the offering of your services to us. The scout of the glade tracked the tome as far as the Mountains of Rathe. I would suggest that be the start of your search. Once you have retrieved the tome, return it to me with haste. We do not want you to be followed or any unnecessary attention being brought to us. When and if you return with the tome, I shall see what I can do to reward your efforts, but without the tome, I fear that my talents are of little use to one of your caliber. But mind you, child, a scout of The Rainkeeper may only use the reward I can provide 



**You say:** `key material`





e.self:Say("There is a blade, a cursed blade that I have held onto for many years now. Until Gurrin came of age and his skills in blacksmithing and his druidic magics had matured, I was unable to purify the curse and use the blade to create one of my finest creations yet. That weapon is the Blade of Rot 



**You say:** `horrible danger`





e.self:Emote("chuckles hoarsely to himself in fond remembrance of his youth, 'We, a group of able, adept, and arrogant adventurers found ourselves in a maelstrom of darkness, chaos, and hate. Aye, my child, we had miraculously found and foolishly walked through a gateway that led to the astral realm of the Prince of Hate. Awestruck, excited, and justly frightened, we dispelled any thoughts to turning away and readied our blades and minds for the battles of our young lives. After all, how could we turn away? This was a true adventure 



**You say:** `turned`





e.self:Say("'Till the day that the Eye of Karana's Storm takes me, I will never forget the sight that fell before us. An unnatural behemoth; a monster of steel, bone, and flesh stood before us. Its blue-black flesh was like a sheet of silk stretched over unnaturally formed muscles beneath an exoskeleton of bone and steel-plated armor. The armor child, the armor breathed! It pulsed with life. . . or death, and it moved 



**You say:** `victor`





e.self:Emote("sighs, his demeanor now strikingly seriously, 'In the finest aspect of the world 



**You say:** `blade`





e.self:Say("When we returned to the Jaggedpine and several weeks after the mourning of our departed loved ones, I took the liberty of inspecting the blade carefully. It was a curious item, although saturated with the corruption and evil of the very seething hatred that inspires all of Innoruuk's creations. Through extensive research and Yanous' aid, I was able to determine that the blade was tied to the Deathrot Knight 



**You say:** `purge the corruption`





>**Kaithys Galestrider says:** Though his powers as a wizard are great, his knowledge did not reach far enough into the occult and the spiritual realms of divine magic. He did what he could and it was more than enough for the time being. As I have already said, I have been waiting patiently for my assistant and apprentice to come of age and mature in his priestly power before I attempted to make proper use of this blade in honor of my brother and beloved's demise. But, the blade was stolen before I was able to present it in secret to Gurrin and I fear that it may have returned to the realm of hate and the Deathrot Knight may again be in existence. We must have the blade returned and the only way you can do this is to venture to the plane of hate and destroy the Deathrot Knight. You must return the blade to Gurrin with the Writ of Thunder and we shall be able to complete what was intended all those years ago.
 



elseif( **Faction is** > Apprehensive) then



>*Kaithys Galestrider calmly clears his throat as he sternly raises a brow in careful study of you, 'Yes... yes, I can see that you have much potential, my friend. But you are young yet to the the ways of The Rainkeeper and your acceptance among our kin of the Jaggedpine has not yet reached a comfortable level that would allow me to extend the necessary trust. Well, perhaps you should return to the wilds and continue your efforts as you have, my friend, and return to me when you feel the grace of The Rainkeeper strengthen about you and the eyes of our people look more fondly upon you. Do not be disheartened, child, for we all must earn our place and I have faith that you will be up to the challenge most suitably.*

>*Kaithys Galestrider curls his lip and gives a gruff noise from his throat in disapproval, 'Begone from me, traveler! The incipid stench of corruption stinks all about you. Perhaps in time, you may find a lather pure enough to wash the stench from your very essence, but only through much effort and strife may you achieve such a feat.*

## Turn-Ins





if( **Faction is** > Warmly and  **You turn in:** [Tome of Thunder](/item/8907)


>*Kaithys Galestrider examines the tome carefully, running his callused hands over the cover and spine and flipping through the ancient parchement within, 'Yes...nicely done, child. It is in miraculous condition for the recent fate that befell it. I am indebted to you and have the noblest intentions to repay your efforts. However, whilst you were away, my smithy was raided and most of my needed supplies to create the item I think a suitable reward for your efforts were stolen by the poachers. I will need to retrieve one of the [key materials] and take it with the Writ of Thunder to my assistant, Gurrin Nitestorm who you may find in the Surefall Glade.'*

>*Kaithys Galestrider takes the blade and intently examines it. Satisfied with the purified quality, he nods to himself and proceeds to remove the gem from the hilt of the blade before returning it to Malvesti, 'You will need to seek out two items and return them to me. Those items are the Essence of Thunder and the Voice of Karana. The essence you will find in The Hole where one known as Ikurenm the Sly resides. Some time ago, before my initial acquisition of the blade, this imp stole the sacred rune from my mentor and only now are we able to retrieve it for its purpose has now reached its dawn. The second item, the Voice of Karana, you will find in the possession of Zrithsadioun the Tainted who wanders the planes of Southern Karana. Zrithsadioun is one of the plague worshiping gnolls of Infected Paw who is so twisted and vile that even his own people have cast him out. Very recently, one of our scouts overheard the gnolls of the shrine discussing a recent loss of their stolen bounty. One of the items that were stolen from them was...*

>*Kaithys Galestrider takes the hollow, smoky orb in one hand and the tiny wooden charm in the other. Slowly, the ancient ranger begins to speak in an unknown dialect. His chant causes the small charm to glow and the air around you to begin to sway in a gentle, chilled breeze. The scent of the storm fills your nostrils as the magical zephyr begins to rage, simulating the coming of a powerful tempest. The old ranger's voice booms out beyond the tempest gale and suddenly, he forces both of his hands together, sealing the small wooden charm of Karana's divine voice into the orb. The magical storm steadily fades as the two pieces are conjoined and handed to Trod, 'This is the Orb of Thunder. Place it within the hilt where the gem had once been and your task will be complete and your reward fulfilled. It has been a pleasure and I thank you for all that you have endeavored to aid me in completing this near half a century long goal of mine. May it serve you well, my friend.*
