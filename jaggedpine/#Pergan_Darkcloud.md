>**Pergan Darkcloud says:** Hello there, Soandso. My wife Nerdala and I have been in the business of making delicacies from the fresh ingredients available locally in our forest. Well, really my wife is the better cook but I'm pretty good at [making Noodles].

**You say:** `making noodles`



>**Pergan Darkcloud says:** Noodles are pretty easy. They are just Flour, Egg and Water. It's how you use [the Noodles] after you make them that is important.

**You say:** `the noodles`



>**Pergan Darkcloud says:** There's a whole bunch of things you can do with them but the best thing you can do with them are to make [pastas] and casseroles.

**You say:** `pasta`



>**Pergan Darkcloud says:** Well, you're going to need to talk to my wife about those recipes. She guards them pretty closely though so you may have to do some prying. Now what I am really good at is making Omelets!
