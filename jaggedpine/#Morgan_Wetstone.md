## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Morgan Wetstone says:** Well met, Soandso. Welcome to the Throne of Karana's Fury!

**You say:** `throne`



>**Morgan Wetstone says:** That is the proper name of our settlement. This clearing was a gift to our ancestors, given to us by Karana! I simply can't believe that a few blasphemous fools actually pushed to change the name to Fort Jaggedpine after all these years. It simply is not right!

**You say:** `fort`



>**Morgan Wetstone says:** Fort Jaggedpine? Bah, this is no military complex! It's just our tiny collection of houses and shops like it has been for generations. I hate the name myself.
