# Garath the Trader
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Garath the Trader says:** Hail to ya, Traveller, and well met! My Name's Garath, a warrior by trade, though I do dabble in some merchanting on the side. My exploring brought me here, and I saw some wonderous things. I ventured inside this ancient tomb with some friends, and oh! The horrors we encountered! I barely made it out alive, but I did manage to pick up some [weapons to trade].

**You say:** `weapon`



>**Garath the Trader says:** Interested in a trade, are ya? Well, let me tell ya.. I headed into this tomb in hopes of getting a sword I could use, maybe a warhammer.. Humm, yeah a hammer woulda been good also.. Anyhow, I was unlucky in finding those, but I did manage to get a couple weapons... Sadly, they're really more suited to a [Monk] or a [Knight], not really much use to a warrior like myself at all.

**You say:** `monk`



>**Garath the Trader says:** Ah, my eyes fail me lately.. Maybe the cold weather is getting to me? Well, in any case, I picked up some velium hand wraps inside the Tomb here, quite nice.. Yes indeed. I guess I would trade them to ya if you were to give me a warhammer for em. I gotta say, I'm not picky. I'd accept either a primal or a priceless warhammer, and give you these wraps in a straight trade. Heck, I'd take one of each and give you both these hand wraps.

**You say:** `knight`



>**Garath the Trader says:** Knight? Yeah, I don't make much distinction, paladin or shadow knight, they're all knights to me. Well, look here, I got two swords from inside the tomb, but I'll be damned if either of em was suited for a warrior. Clearly a knight's blade, what bad luck for me. I was hopin for a good warsword. That's why I'm standin out here ya know? I was hopin I could find someone who might swap me either a primal or priceless warsword, and take one of these knightly swords in trade.
