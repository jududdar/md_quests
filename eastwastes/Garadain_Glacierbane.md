# Garadain Glacierbane
## Dialog






**You say:** `hail`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** Hrmff, what's this? A spy sent from the giant heathens, or the selfrighteous wurms perhaps? Either way, you'd be no [friend] of the great Coldain.

**You say:** `friend`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** A friend, you say? That remains to be seen. Much more to being a friend of the Coldain than just sayin' so. Anyway, I'm too [tired] to argue about it. I haven't slept in days.

**You say:** `tired`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** Did I say tired? Exhausted is more like it. Ever since that blizzard last week I haven't slept a wink. I came back from huntin' snow orcs to find that my [blanket] had blown away and now I'm just too tired to rustle up a new one.

**You say:** `blanket`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** Not just any old blanket, mind ye, mine was made of the finest tundra kodiak hides and snow panther skins, two of each. When I was wrapped up in it ya couldn't see me a bit, no, I blended right into the snow, I did. Say, if you be a friend, here's yer chance to prove it. Sew me up a new blanket so I can get some rest.



 


**You say:** `nephew`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** My nephew, Boridain, keeps running away from home to kill a bothersome [beast], thinking this will prove to all of Thurgadin that he is a great hunter. Every time he does this my sister gets hysterical and I am sent out to find him.

**You say:** `beast`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** A rabid tundra kodiak has been feeding on our people for weeks now. If Boridain ever stumbled across the critter I doubt he'd stand a chance. I have a solution, but it would require the [assistance] of an outsider.

**You say:** `assistance`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** I'm taking a liking to you, stranger. Your eagerness to help us will not go unnoticed. Find my nephew and give him this axe. It should keep him from hurting himself. Return to me with the ring and proof that he is safe.


**You receive:**  [Dull Bladed Axe](/item/30265)



 


**You say:** `hunting`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** My camp here boasts the most proficient hunters in the recorded history of the mighty Coldain empire. We alone could feed an entire clan. Things have been frustratingly [slow] lately, though.

**You say:** `slow`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** After years of skinning the hides of the giantmen, my hunting knife has lost its edge. The dull blade has slowed me down considerably. It has served me well, but a new [knife] would make me a much more proficient hunter.

**You say:** `knife`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** Hunt a wooly rhino and take his horn, then take a flawless hide from a walrus. Combine them in a forge with a skinning rock and bring me the new knife and the silver insignia ring.



 


**You say:** `smithing hammer`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** [Tain] Hammerfrost can get you one. Find him and give him this.


**You receive:**  [Note to Tain](/item/30139)

**You say:** `tain`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** Tain left a short time ago, he said he had a score to settle with a particular Kromriff.



 


**You say:** `plans`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** The bloody Ry'Gorr, friends of the frost giants, plan to raid our encampment. Their captain, Scarbrow Ga'hruk is leading the raid. I need someone to intercept his [orders] so we may prepare for the attack. Without them we could be in serious trouble.

**You say:** `orders`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** Find the Ry'Gorr messenger and cut him down. Bring the message he carries to my lookout. When the attack is thwarted, return to me with the head of Scarbrow and the platinum insignia ring.



 


**You say:** `favor`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** For several seasons there has been an unsolved mystery in this land. Not far from here an elite team of Coldain and their trained wolves were gathered to make a strike at the Kromrif. No one knows just what became of our strike force. Bring me proof of their fate and proof that whoever was responsible for their loss is no more.



 


**You say:** `mission`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** A Coldain... A very important Coldain, has been abducted by the Rygorr. He was gathering information that is imperative to our victory over the brainless heathens. You must find him before he is killed and escort him to safety. Return to me with proof that Corbin Blackwell is safe.



 


**You say:** `ready`



>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** Very well, Soandso, give me the Adamantite ring and I will give you the marching orders. Once the orders are given to Gloradin in the next hut, we will be underway. You then must follow me to what will be our battleground. I must warn you, I will hold your ring until the head of Chief Ry\`gorr is given to me. If we fail, all will be lost... for both of us.

if **You turn in:** [Coldain Hunting Blanket](/item/30135)


>**Garadain Glacierbane says:** Ahh, that'll do fine. Take this, it is but a trinket for now, but continue to serve the Coldain and it will grow in power. I must get some rest now, for I have been told my [nephew] has disappeared again and I will need to track him down tomorrow.
