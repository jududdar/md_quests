**You say:** `wares`



>**Bndainy Everhot says:** The various molds that I have for sale are used in the smithing of weapons. Simply use the necessary molds with a sheet of metal, a forge, and a water flask. Weapons with hilts and pommels will also need molds for those pieces and weapons such as pole-arms and axes require an oak shaft.
