# Ragunk Everhot


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Ragunk Everhot says:** Ye Gods, that's the stuff!'  Ragunk burps loudly as he takes a swig from a small flask on his forge.  'Fit for the King himself!  Maybe I can get this [armor] finished on time!

**You say:** `armor`



>**Ragunk Everhot says:** Don't interrupt me, child.  I'm drinking.'  Ragunk staggers and takes another swig from his flask.  'Say, do you know anything about [chainmail] or [platemail]?

**You say:** `chainmail`



>**Ragunk Everhot says:** Hah!  I thought not.  I've recently come into contact with a very interesting person.  Very interesting indeed.'  Rungak burps again.  'Not that I ever saw his face mind, that bloody dark robe is enormous!  He did have some good ideas about [brellium] though.

**You say:** `platemail`



>**Ragunk Everhot says:** Heavy duty stuff, very serious it is.  With enchanted brellium chain jointing, my dwarven hammer, earthen temper, a small plate mold and a few [infused sheets] of brellium, the sky is the limit!  It looks as if it'd take imbuing, too.

**You say:** `brellium`



>**Ragunk Everhot says:** Well, he showed me how to work it into stronger rings than before.  Taking a few velium rings, and then working in a large brick of enchanted brellium, with my dwarven  smithy hammer, and a little [strange temper].  Then I used that to make the chainmail.  Such a simple [method]!

**You say:** `infused sheet`



>**Ragunk Everhot says:** An enchanted large brick of brellium can be worked into a folded velium sheet with a dwarven smithy hammer.  Don't forget that [strange temper], too - that's the secret to all this!

**You say:** `strange temper`



>**Ragunk Everhot says:** My new friend gave me enough to make several sets of armor, it really is quite something.'  Ragunk takes a mouthful of pungent drink from his flask, you think that his eyes look a little nervous.  'I'm not sure what's in it, but my old Dwarven eyes detected a fine, blue powder within.  Who knows!

**You say:** `method`



>**Ragunk Everhot says:** You're all questions, aren't you!  Take your dwarven hammer, and a small piece of leather armor, earthen temper, a small sectional mold and then some of the infused brellium rings, and you've a handy set of linked chain!  I may try imbuing later, maybe peridot or ruby would work.  All in the dwarf forge, of course!
