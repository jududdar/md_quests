# Trantor Everhot




## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Trantor Everhot says:** Yes, yes!! I am a very busy man. I've got blueprints to work on, [dwarven wire] to perfect and formulae to calculate. In between those tasks, I have to find time to head down to Irontoe's and down a few Tumpy Tonics.

**You say:** `dwarven wire`



>**Trantor Everhot says:** Oh!! Interested in my dwarven wire, are you? Many are. I have no problem letting you use a spool, but I have to warn you that I have not perfected the strength of it yet. I will make you a trade. A couple of [Tumpy Tonics] for a spool.

**You say:** `tumpy tonics`



>**Trantor Everhot says:** Aaah!! I love Tumpy Tonics. They were created by Tumpy Irontoe. He was once a member of the famed Irontoe Brigade. Since they disbanded and left for parts unknown he decided to stay in Kaladim and open Irontoe's, the finest well in Faydwer.

**You say:** `irontoe`



>**Trantor Everhot says:** If you're asking about the Brigade, who knows where they are?! If you're looking for Irontoe Tavern, it's here in Kaladim, near the arena.

>**Trantor Everhot says:** Great! I did not have the time to get down to Irontoe's today. Here. Like I said. A spool of dwarven wire. Now go away. I ain't sharing these tonics.
