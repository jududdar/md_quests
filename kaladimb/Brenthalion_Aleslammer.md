If you are able to collect all the items for them you will have the potential to make a full set of Underfoot Defenders Platemail! If\`n ye are [ready to begin] collecting yer items I will be happy to give you your Magical Mail Assembly Kit and git you started!

I can provide you with the material recipe and enchanted armor molds for Underfoot Platemail [Helm], [Bracer], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets], and [Breastplate].
