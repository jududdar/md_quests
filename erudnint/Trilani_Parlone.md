>**Trilani Parlone says:** I sense a great evil power in this candlestick. I will need you to concoct a divinatory aid for me before I can discern more. Take this suspension and brew it in a brew barrel with one white hellebore, a pouch of the red dust created by the Fire Peak Goblin Wizards, and the caustic substance used by the werebats in Unrest.

>*Trilani Parlone performs a subtle divinatory ritual. 'This is a powerful evil indeed. The smoke from special candles crafted by the Teir'Dal and burned in this candlestick allows the creation of undead of unordinary might. The Ghasts are only one of its many possible creations. I will concoct a powder for you to take back to Yeolarn that will assist in defeating the monstrosities the candle has produced. The candlestick itself will remain here within the High Tower of Erudin for the time being.'*
