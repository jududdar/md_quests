# Akbaq Salid



## Dialog

if ( **Faction is** >= Indifferent) then 



**You say:** `hail`




>**Akbaq Salid says:** Greetings, Soandso. I have recently returned to Erudin since hearing word of the titan spirits that inhabit the Stonebrunt Mountains. Should you be heading in that direction there are some [samples] that I am interested in acquiring.


**You say:** `sample`




>**Akbaq Salid says:** The titan spirits of the Stonebrunt Mountains appear in several various animal forms seemingly with different areas of influence in the spirit world. I am interested in conducting some experiments on the hides of the giant leopard titan and the giant sabretooth titan. Once I have acquired those hides I will seek to conduct experiments on the [others].


**You say:** `other`




>**Akbaq Salid says:** Once I have finished my studies of the feline titans pelts I am interested in experimenting with the hides of the strongest of the stonebrunt titans, the gigantic gorilla and the gargantuan panda. The [ancient snake] that inhabits those mountains is another matter that you may be interested in as well.


**You say:** `ancient snake`




>**Akbaq Salid says:** I believe I have uncovered a process with which to harness the mystical properties of the scales of the snake titan so that they can be fashioned into a powerful robe. If you bring me the ancient snake skin and some platinum thread I am sure there will be enough material to craft multiple robes and I shall reward you with one for your assistance.
