**You say:** `tonic`



>**Shondo Billin says:** Oh, why did I have to try and help that Erudite in Qeynos? He was sick and vomiting and needed something called Erud's Tonic!! Now just because I wanted to help, I am going to be vomiting up my insides!! Oh, Brell!!! GET ME OUT OF HERE!!

**You say:** `where is the heretic`



>**Shondo Billin says:** Why are you asking me about the heretic?! I am going to die! DO YOU HEAR ME?!! Oh, I need a drink. Please... honor a dying man's last request, a bottle of Vasty Deep Ale. If you get me that, I will tell you what I know of the heretic.

## Turn-Ins




if( **You turn in:** [Vasty Deep Ale](/item/13126)) then


>**Shondo Billin says:** Gulp.. Gulp.. Aaahhh!!! That hits the spot. All I can tell you is that the heretic's name was E'lial B'rook. He mumbled something about a rendezvous and he would be floating down a river, smooth sailing back to something called Paineel. That's all I know.
