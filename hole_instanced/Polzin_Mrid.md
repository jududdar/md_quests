# Polzin Mrid

## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Polzin Mrid says:** Yes, young one?

**You say:** `test of the phantasm`



>**Polzin Mrid says:** It will be simple, go collect these items and return them to me. Head of a serpent, essence of a ghost, essence of a vampire, and sands of the mystics. Do so and you will receive the last of the pieces. Be sure to combine them in a sack first. Just ask and I will provide you with one.

**You say:** `head of a serpent`



>**Polzin Mrid says:** Serpent is probably not an accurate term for what you must return to me. It is actaully the reminants of a spirit. The spirit is one which was erradicated long long ago by the Iksar. I believe they were called the Shissar. You may need to travel to the Iksar city to learn more about these creatures.

**You say:** `essence of a ghost`



>**Polzin Mrid says:** You don't have to look far to find roaming spirits. One in particular though has more meaning then the other sorry souls trapped here. You see, Kindle was a dear friend of mine. I came in search of him when he stopped writing. Well...look at me now. I fear that I have succumbed to the same fate as poor Kindle.

**You say:** `essence of a vampire`



>**Polzin Mrid says:** The essence of a vampire is just that. Only the most powerful of these creatures will possess what you need.

**You say:** `sands of the mystic`



>**Polzin Mrid says:** They are sands that were imbued with the magical might of the mystics. Mystics use a ritual involving their own blood to create a powerful bond with the sand. One will need to search the shores.

**You say:** `sack`



>**Polzin Mrid says:** Before I provide the item, you must show me that you have spoken to Jeb.
