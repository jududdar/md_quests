# Stofo Olan


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Stofo Olan says:** Good day, I have discovered something truly wonderful! If I only had the materials required so I can copy my notes and send them to my teacher.

**You say:** `discover`



>**Stofo Olan says:** I was researching a new spell, and discovered new information concerning the history of the Serpent.

**You say:** `material`



>**Stofo Olan says:** The materials I need are a mechanical pen, ink of the dark, and white paper. Bring me those and I will give you a copy of this information.

**You say:** `teacher`



>**Stofo Olan says:** My teacher is Jeb Lumsed. He was last seen in the regions of the newly discovered lands of Kunark. If you wish to find him that is where you must seek him out.

**You say:** `ink of the dark`



>**Stofo Olan says:** Dark illusions, thievery, and the plague of the living will guide you. These are the only hints I can provide. Safe travels and may you be protected from all maladies.

**You say:** `mechanical pen`



>**Stofo Olan says:** The answer you seek is in your question. If you are unable to figure it out, then perhaps you are not ready to travel along this path.

**You say:** `white paper`



>**Stofo Olan says:** It may seem like ordinary paper at first. However, this paper was enchanted by a friend of mine. This paper was given to a lass in the Karanas to help with her writings. The paper will guide her hands and draw forth the thoughts in her mind. I no longer have any and I have not had contact with my friend in some time. Search them out.
