## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Weltria Ostriss says:** Good day. Soandso. I assist in maintaining an accurate collection of historical tomes here in the great library of Erudin. One of our citizens recently escaped the dungeons of the Kobold warrens and tells of a Kobold lore keeper who keeps a collection of scrolls detailing the history of their kind. Are you capable of obtaining those scrolls for our library?

**You say:** `am capable`



>**Weltria Ostriss says:** Take this case and return it to me when you have collected all of the scrolls.
