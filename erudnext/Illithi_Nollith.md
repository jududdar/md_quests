## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Illithi Nollith says:** Shhhh... Greetings, Soandso. Welcome to the Library of Erudin. Please respect the other patrons and speak softly.

**You say:** `testament of vanear`



>**Illithi Nollith says:** Oh my!! You have not heard?! The Testament of Vanear was stolen from the library! It was checked out by a man named Moodoro. He is an Erudite, but I believe he was executed for some crime. Now the book is lost forever. You should speak with Tol Nicelot. He used to know Moodoro. Tol is most likely upstairs.
