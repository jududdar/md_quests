## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Tomekeeper Danl says:** Good day, citizen. Please remember to keep your voice down in our library. Feel free to browse the extensive collection of books we have on display. Learning is all about you. Our library is the greatest collection of educational literature in the world, as you can no doubt see. If you come across any [rare finds] we may be interested in purchasing them.

**You say:** `rare find`



>**Tomekeeper Danl says:** Yes, any rare books, tomes, essays, or other literature you find may be of interest to me. Although the finds I am interested in are quite high profile and would most likely only be found in the possession of very powerful or influential beings. Give me what you find and I will pay you what it is worth to us.

**You say:** `lheao`



>**Tomekeeper Danl says:** Lheao was my predecessor here at the library of Erudin. He has since retired, just a few years ago. Im sure he would be most impressed with your find and other insightful conversation on the subject. Although Im not sure one of your profession would be interested in such a scholarly endeavor, no offense. If you are interested, find him and tell him you found the book Immortals. Im not sure where he has retired to, but I hear it is near an ocean somewhere.
