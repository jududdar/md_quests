# Saumeem Unja
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Saumeem Unja says:** Hail Soandso, it is a pleasure to meet you. As the Governor of Defense for Katta Castellum it is my duty to ensure the safety of the city from outside enemies. At present the most imminent threat to the safety of our citizens is the Coterie of the Eternal Night and their [assassins]. There are other matters of defense as well however that you may be of [assistance] in dealing with.

**You say:** `assassins`






>**Saumeem Unja says:** The Coterie of the Eternal Night has trained several of their members to infiltrate the defenses of Katta Castellum and capture or kill citizens of our great city. Few of these assassins are successful at breaching the gate but the ones that do succeed tend to hide in shadowy corners waiting for an opportune moment to emerge and attack their victims. Should you discover one of these undead assassins slay it immediately. Kill four such assassins and deliver their Coterie Assassin Garrotes to me and you shall be honored by the Validus Custodus.

**You say:** `assistance`






>**Saumeem Unja says:** Ah... Im glad that you have asked. There is a special matter that may benefit from your skills as an adventurer. I would love to explain the matter in full detail, but Im afraid that I am not your best source of information at this juncture. The matter was delegated to Kellari Autumnfall. Seek her out and see if she requires your assistance. She is looking into a matter of grave importance. Tell her that I sent you, should she ask. Be well and good luck with it.

**You say:** `coterie infiltrators`






>**Saumeem Unja says:** They are undead Illusionists capable of disguising themselves as mortals. The signs of an infiltrator are often difficult to spot but should you identify an infiltrator within the city slay it, bring me two of the creatures fangs, a Gem of Condensed Flame and your Reflective Combine Claymore and I shall bestow upon you a greater reward.
