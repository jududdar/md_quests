>**Yaeorat says:** Ah, a Gemmed sword hilt attached with a note from my old friend Daloran. It is a shame that I have not seen him for such a long time. Being so busy with my work has prevented me from seeing and of my family or friends, really. Alas, this hilt has a positive energy eminating from it and not destructive as Daloran feared. Please take this back to him as I'm sure he awaits it.
