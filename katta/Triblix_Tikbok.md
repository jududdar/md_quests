# Triblix Tikbok
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Triblix Tikbok says:** Pleasure to meet ya! Have you come to the Illuminarium Industria to gaggle about or have you come looking for [some work]?

**You say:** `some work`



>**Triblix Tikbok says:** Well in that case I sure could use the assistance of a powerful $race such as yourself. You see my job here is to construct the lighting for Katta Castellum and Im always in need of more supplies. I need a fresh supply of [zelniak oil] for the standard city street lanterns and a fresh supply of [acrylian phosphate] to construct more phosporous lanterns and torches.

**You say:** `acrylian phosphate`






>**Triblix Tikbok says:** Acrylian phosphate is an uncommon mineral deposit containing the same mineral compound that provides acrylia ore with its self luminescence. The acrylian phosphate also burns very well and at extremely high temperatures for very long periods of time. I will trade with you for every four piles of acrylian phosphate you can supply me.

**You say:** `zelniak oil`






>**Triblix Tikbok says:** Zelniaks are strange creatures that live on the light side of Luclin. Their fat can be boiled in a brew barrel with a flask of water and poured into an empty bottle to produce an oil that is an excellent fuel for lanterns. I will trade for every four bottles of zelniak oil you produce for me.
