# Tilbok Furrunner


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Tilbok Furrunner says:** Hello there, Soandso. Pleasure to meet you, I am Governor Tilbok Furrunner. I am tasked with the gathering and security of information for the Concilium Universus, the ruling council of our fine city.

**You say:** `purpose`



>**Tilbok Furrunner says:** The teaching in the city is that Katta feigned his death to blame it on Seru. When in fact Seru actually poisoned Katta. The crusade that Seru leads is false and must be stopped. We must gain access to Seru's [chambers] and destroy him and show the city the truth.

**You say:** `chambers`



>**Tilbok Furrunner says:** We do not know much about Seru's Chamber, that is what we need you to find out. This will require great effort on your part. We need you to infiltrate Sanctus Seru and bring back reports from each Consillium. I do not know who will have these reports, and I have only heard rumor that they exist. Return to me with the Satchel full, and your Etched Earring.

**You say:** `action`



>**Tilbok Furrunner says:** You must go see Lcea. She was Tsaph Katta's closest advisor. This matter has escalated greatly and must be placed in her hands. Ask her about the [Arx Key] she will no doubt ask in your service retrieving it. I salute your service to the city and wish you well.

**You say:** `praesertum`



>**Tilbok Furrunner says:** The four Praesertum can be found in the center of the city. Each has their own building, easily identified by the symbol above the main entrance. Stay clear of the Arx Seru, the central building. This is the resting place of Seru, who does not allow anyone but the Praesertum to disturb him. To venture inside is death for all that are not invited.

**You say:** `who is Seru`



>**Tilbok Furrunner says:** Seru is the genius behind the Combine Empire. A man of unfailing honor and honesty, he devised the Inquisition, to root out unclean elements in the Empire. His saddest day was when he discovered that Katta himself was a traitor. When confronted with proof of his treachery, Katta feigned his own murder, and fled to Luclin. Seru had no choice but to amass an expedition and follow after him.

**You say:** `i will help`



>**Tilbok Furrunner says:** Excellent. Find Claudius and give that to him- it's gibberish but he and his new friends won't know that now will they? We have been watching someone named Vahn enter the city under the guise of a trader. We know he works for Seru, but we were not sure what he was doing here, so we let him be- trouble was he kept giving us the slip passing through the tunnels. Looks now like we may have found a connection. The plan sounds complicated and I don't want to confuse you, but if you stick with me it will all go just fine. You with me so far, Soandso?


 **You receive:**  [Recording Stone](/item/29846) 

**You say:** `i am with you`



>**Tilbok Furrunner says:** OK, now you follow Claudius but not so closely that he can see you. Keep this stone on you, it is imbued with the power to record anything spoken within a certain distance and will be a great asset to us when this is all said and done. If Claudius does meet up with Vahn, I want you to walk right up to him and say, 'traitor to the Validus Custodus' and do it quickly- they won't give you much time. That should rattle him a bit and it will be the signal for my men to come in and take care of them. After the arrest, just give that recording stone to Condor. Best of luck to you, Soandso.

**You say:** `Where is claudius`



>**Tilbok Furrunner says:** Claudius is a bit of a lazy sod anyway. If he ain't asleep in a bunk downstairs right now, you can bet your undergarments he will be soon.

## Turn-Ins





if( **You turn in:** [Report to Tilbok](/item/29891)) then 


>*Tilbok Furrunner reads through the report, hands you a small satchel then starts to explain. 'Finally, news from Euzan. I knew that it would take a long time to get planted within Seru, but I still worried about their mission constantly. This report shows that you have earned trust from Euzan, so I in turn will show the same trust. Euzan and Torsten were placed in the city for information. They are deep undercover and risk their life everyday. Every person in that city is ingrained with the [purpose] of either destroying Katta or converting his people.'*
