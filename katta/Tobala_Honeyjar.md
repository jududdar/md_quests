**You say:** `rare plants`



>**Tobala Honeyjar says:** I am seeking seeds and plants that I may extract the seeds from that are native to the light side of Luclin so that I am prepared should the Illuminarium Industria succeed in constructing a lantern that will provide the plants with the nutrients they need to survive here on the dark side.
