# Sentry Emil
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Sentry Emil says:** Ah, hello, you must be the strangers that call yourselves friend to the Kin. Perhaps you would be interested in proving your worth?

**You say:** `interest`



>**Sentry Emil says:** Good, then perhaps you wouldn't mind performing a small task then? With the betrayal of Kragen Morshire, the kin retreated from the Skyshrine and have taken up residence in the Tunare Court. Before I was called to guard the gate, I had been assigned to deliver a report to them. If you indeed wish to be friend to the kin, take this report to the Wakening. Eysa Florawhisper. She will give you a token indicating that she has received the message, return this to me and we may see a reward.

Continue to prove your loyalty and greater rewards you may see, perhaps the greatest of all.. in time.  I must go now and report this to my superiors.  Farewell.
