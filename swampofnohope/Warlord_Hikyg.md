# Warlord Hikyg
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Warlord Hikyg says:** What business do you have speaking to an Iksar Warlord? Be gone before you find yourself served as my evening meal. Go to Captain Nedar if you wish to assist my garrison. Fool.

**You say:** `trooper reporting for duty`



>**Warlord Hikyg says:** It is about time they sent new troopers for my garrison!! This is the toughest garrison in Kunark!! And you're going to help prove it. The legion needs to get a hold of some new frog shields called Krup warrior guards. You're going to take this pack and fill it with not one, but four!! When you can return a full, combined pack to me, maybe you will show me that you're not as weak as you look!!

**You say:** `geozite`



>**Warlord Hikyg says:** Do not speak to me of the geozite tool.  Seek out Drill Master Vygan within the Fortress of Talishan.  He shall answer your questions.

>**Warlord Hikyg says:** Ah!! Good to have you on board. We lack strong young recruits such as yourself. Take this bag. Your task is to seek escaped frogloks near this gate. Apparently, the slaves have been breaking loose from their shackles and attempting to head home. Fill and combine within the bag their broken shackles and return the filled box to me for your geozite tool.
