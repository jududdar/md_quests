# Dugroz




## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Dugroz says:** Fffrroaaak!!  Go away!  I don't want to [work for them] anymore! Go find another slave!

**You say:** `work`



>*Dugroz looks relieved and eyes you, considering. Finally, he begins to recant his tale. 'I was once the slave of an important Iksar necromancer. I was his Dugroz, his head slave. One night, I heard two other slaves talking about me. I could barely hear them but what I did hear frightened me. My master was going to use me one last time. He was going to sacrifice me to craft a spell component for one of his most powerful spells. Hearing this, I used my privileges as his head slave and made my [escape].'*

**You say:** `escape`



>**Dugroz says:** After I escaped, I lost myself in the depths of the swamp. I discarded all the keys but one. I will gladly give it to you if you can do me a [small favor].

**You say:** `small favor`



>*Dugroz Dugroz blinks his eyes and leans forward. He whispers so quietly you must strain to hear him, 'I have taken up the same magics as my master. I require two components to complete a spell I have been researching for quite some time. The first is a vampire's fang. I have heard tales of a vampire who haunts the ruins of Kaesora. I also need a jade weapon stained by the blood of a chokidai. Look in the Lake of Ill Omen at the sarnak outpost. The leader used to herd chokidai, or so I am told.'*
