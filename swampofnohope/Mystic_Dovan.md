# Mystic Dovan




## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>*Mystic Dovan shows the signs of a great mystic. You can feel the power resonating from his aura. 'Greetings and may the cursed blessings of Cazic-Thule be yours. What may I do for you this fine evening? Perhaps I can [cure disease] or [heal] you, perhaps even [purge toxins] from your system?*

**You say:** `cure disease`



>**Mystic Dovan says:** Your malady shall dissipate once you deliver to me one giant blood sac.

**You say:** `heal`



>**Mystic Dovan says:** I can call upon the power of the ancients to mend your wounds if you can deliver to me two brittle Iksar skulls.

**You say:** `purge toxins`



>**Mystic Dovan says:** The toxins shall surely be purged from your system when I have proof of your allegiance to the empire. Let that proof be one goblin watcher signal torch.

**You say:** `rok nilok`



>**Mystic Dovan says:** Mystic Dovan lowers his head in sorrow let us have a moment of peace. I cannot find the words to speak of the unspeakable act of the gods which took the lives of the legendary Crusaders of Rok Nolok. You must find the answers for yourself. All I can do is wait for their return. 

**You say:** `galdon vok nir?`



>**Mystic Dovan says:** He is a merchant hiding in The Overthere. He is greedy and will not give the skull up easily. Seek him out and ask him what he would [trade] for the skull.
