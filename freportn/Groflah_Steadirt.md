>**Groflah Steadirt says:** I am afraid I have some bad news, Steel Warrior. I had one of my workers take the raw blades out to be engraved by the Rivervale craftsmen. On his return, he was killed by the orcs in the Commonlands. The orcs now have the blades in their possession. I believe they have a camp nearby in the Commonlands. You may still be able to find all four blades within their camp and return them to Larn Brugal. Good Luck.

>**Groflah Steadirt says:** Where did you find this? This was the main price list of Zimel's Blades, but it should be all burnt up. I was at Zimel's right after the fire and I did not see it hanging where it should have been. The entire inside was gutted and . . . wait . . . the sequence of the dots!! Hmmm. I cannot talk with you here. Meet me at the Seafarer's by the docks at night. Give me the note when next we meet.
