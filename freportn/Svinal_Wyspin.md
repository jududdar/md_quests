>**Svinal Wyspin says:** What!!? Looking for a boat beacon? We may be getting one from Ak'Anon in about a year. You can always try to make one. Find a greater lightstone, a metal disk and a copper band. If you have a beacon mount, go to a forge and combine them all. It's not that hard, but it's not that easy, either.
