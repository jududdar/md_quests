## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Svinal Wyspin says:** Welcome, welcome, welcome! This is the Emporium. If we don't have it, we can get it!!

**You say:** `boat beacon`



>**Svinal Wyspin says:** What!!? Looking for a boat beacon? We may be getting one from Ak'Anon in about a year. You can always try to make one. Find a greater lightstone, a metal disk and a copper band. If you have a beacon mount, go to a forge and combine them all. It's not that hard, but it's not that easy, either.
