# Akksstaff


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Akksstaff says:** What do you want?! Foolish " .. e.other:Race() .. ", I am in no mood to treat with beggars. I have half a mind to turn my pet here loose on you! Well, don't keep me waiting, state your business or be off with you!

**You say:** `tell me about magi'kot`



>**Akksstaff says:** Ah, that I can help you with. Magi'kot was a powerful elementalist, able to control the power of the elements which surrounded him. He was not able to fully master the elements when I was learning from him, but soon after my departure I heard rumors that he was going after the Orb of Mastery. At the time, I did not feel he was ready to harness all the elements, but Magi'kot listened to no one. He was in search of power beyond any held by a mortal. Do you wish to hear more?

**You say:** `wish to hear more`



>**Akksstaff says:** Then bring me the torn pages of Mastery, there are four pages that can be found upon the women In this keep, though have a care, Najena's followers guard her treasures carefully, and delight in punishing trespassers.
