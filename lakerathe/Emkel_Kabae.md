**You say:** `symbol of the serpent`



>**Emkel Kabae says:** There are more reagents to be gathered. The time draws near for our master's ascension. Travel to the lands of Kunark and seek out Ssessthrass. He is a very wise Iksar herbalist helping me in my endeavor to please Master Kazen. Be careful not to insult his speech, or you mayup dead before you serve your purpose to the master.
