**You say:** `hail`



>**Trooper Chikzik says:** The ruined city of Kaesora lies in the Field of Bone.  Death walks the grounds surrounding the ruins.  I have heard of many young sorcerers of the Brood of Kotiz dying within its towers, trying to uncover the location of Kaesora's legendary library.
