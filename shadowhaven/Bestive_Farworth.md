## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Bestive Farworth says:** Hello, Soandso. I have some heavy duty ruff 'n tuff storage devices for sale. You may not want to carry them 'round much, unless you're the burly type. Even the beetle box I made is kinda heavy.

**You say:** `beetle box`



>**Bestive Farworth says:** You're interested in it?  Great!  I made this beetle box from the undamaged carapace of a Rhino Beetle. It was sold to me for a very fair price in the Bazaar. Should you discover one of these pristine, undamaged carapaces, bring it to me along with 10 gold and I will make you one of your own.
