**You say:** `hail`



>**Mark Blotter says:** Hail, friend! Feel free to browse my selection of scrolls and scroll accessories but be careful when handling them, some of them are quite old and the parchment has seen better days.

**You say:** `golden seal tube`



>**Mark Blotter says:** Ah hah! You are in luck. I just received a sealed golden scroll tube the other day that I think you will find quite acceptable. It seems to be quite old and the craftsmanship is superb! I will part with it for no less than one-thousand gold pieces.
