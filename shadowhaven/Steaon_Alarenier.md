## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Steaon Alarenier says:** Hail, Soandso. You will have to excuse me because I am quite busy with my work and trying to sort out my [deliveries]. However, please help yourself to anything in my store that may be to your liking.

**You say:** `deliver`



>**Steaon Alarenier says:** You see, I have to make more and more deliveries everyday, what with my business growing so much. I find it difficult to make time to go pick up the different skins and pelts I need for my trade. It's tough when you need some good help but can't afford to pay them. Sorry to bother you with my banter, perhaps I will find someone on the [way to the bazaar].

**You say:** `way to the bazaar`



>**Steaon Alarenier says:** You are, eh Soandso? Well then if you wanted to pick up some supplies for me and deliver them to my partner in the Bazaar I'm sure I would be very grateful. Would you like to make a [trip to the bazaar]?

**You say:** `trip to the bazaar`



>**Steaon Alarenier says:** All right! Great to hear that Soandso. Here are the supplies I need delivered to my partner Gearo in the Bazaar. Please take them to him and return with whatever he has picked up for me. I look forward to seeing you soon, and thank you.
