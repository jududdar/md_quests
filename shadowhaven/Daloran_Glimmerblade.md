# Daloran Glimmerblade




## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Daloran Glimmerblade says:** Greetings, Soandso. I am Lord Daloran Glimmerblade. I preside over the Fordel section of the Haven with my dear Mistala. I have not seen you around these parts, so I would imagine you are a [newcomer] to our great city.

**You say:** `newcomer`



>**Daloran Glimmerblade says:** Excellent, Soandso. It's nice to have you here as a guest. I am very proud of all that we have accomplished here, and I invite you to make yourself at home when you are with us. If you wish to further [prove your allegiance] to the House of Fordel I may have some tasks for you to complete.

**You say:** `prove my allegiance`



>**Daloran Glimmerblade says:** Ah that is excellent to hear, Soandso. I believe I have a task that I could entrust you with. I have numerous Gemmed sword hilts that I have yet to attach to a blade. They have all been glowing for quite some time with an [unknown force]. All of my residing magicians and enchanters have been unable to decipher the magics that surround these hilts.

**You say:** `unknown force`



>**Daloran Glimmerblade says:** I wish that I was able to discover this myself. Unfortunately not one person in my quarter possesses such identification powers. However, I do have a [friend] in Katta Castellum that specializes in discovering such magical origins.

**You say:** `friend`



>**Daloran Glimmerblade says:** Yaeorat is who I speak of, he is a very trusted and old friend of mine that is a very powerful and skillfull enchanter. Will you bring to him the [Gemmed sword hilt]? I feel that if anyone will be able to identify this it will be Yaeorat.

**You say:** `gemmed sword hilt`



>**Daloran Glimmerblade says:** That is great to hear, Soandso. Here is the hilt. Please go see Yaeorat at once and bring me news about the magic that surrounds this sword hilt good or bad.

>**Daloran Glimmerblade says:** Fantastic work, Soandso. It would seem that this hilt is fit to be attached to a blade and distributed amongst my guards. I have many other hilts that I need delivered to Yaeorat should you choose to courier another in the future. Until then good luck to you.
