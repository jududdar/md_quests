>*Lareso Runsalark looks upon you with a face covered with soot, 'Lo there!  As my brother will tell you today is indeed a grand day!  I was stuck behind that rubble in the Nexus for quite some time.  I imagine that I am  hungry from the whole ordeal.  More importantly though, I am thirsty!  Waitress!  Another ale over here please!*
