## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Faeroi says:** Hi there Soandso. It's nice to meet ye. Many great deals here today if I don't say so myself.

**You say:** `piece`



>**Faeroi says:** I'm waiting to have a rhino beetle horn delivered to me to finish off Hardam's helm. I do not want to present it to him with one horn, you know.
