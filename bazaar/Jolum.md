# Jolum
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Jolum says:** Hail! Nice to see ya, friend. I've got a fine selection of spankin' good spells, perhaps you'd be interested? Or maybe you'd like to learn how to [upgrade] your Grandmaster Trade items? Still yet, maybe you would like to know how to create a [Grandmaster's Medicine Bag]?

**You say:** `upgrade`



>**Jolum says:** What Grandmaster Trade item would you like to know how to upgrade? I can tell you how to upgrade your [Grandmaster Baker's Spoon], [Grandmaster Brewer's Corker], [Grandmaster Fletcher's Knife], [Grandmaster Jeweler's Eyeglass], [Grandmaster Potter's Sculpter], [Grandmaster Smith's Hammer], [Grandmaster Tailor's Needle], or your [Grandmaster Tinker's Spanner]. While you can't have more than one of the new items, they will summon a [bag] for you. Very useful for carrying heavy items about and such.

**You say:** `bag`



>**Jolum says:** Its a very sturdy bag, but I'm afraid that it's only temporary. If you'd like to get a more permanent bag, just hand me your summoned one and I'll trade it out you.
