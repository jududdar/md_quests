**You say:** `hail`




>**a lesser spirit says:** Did you take this person's life, shaman?


**You say:** `yes`




>**a lesser spirit says:** Why have you taken this person's life, Soandso? Did he threaten your life? Did you dislike him? Or was his death a profit to you in some way?


**You say:** `threatened my life`




>**a lesser spirit says:** I see. It brings me sadness to see another die, but his heart was black and a great nothingness. His body will become the grass now. Thank you for what you have done, shaman.


**You say:** `what are you`




>**a lesser spirit says:** What, or who, I am isn't as important as what, or who, WE are. Do you wish to know more, shaman?


**You say:** `know more`




>**a lesser spirit says:** That is good, Soandso. Take this gem. It is a part of us like the clouds to the sky and is a wonderful gift from the grandfather. Take this gem to where the humans gather to spoil the land and water. Some call it a port. There you will find one of us, a shaman like yourself. Give him the gem and perhaps he will tell you more of the spirits.
