## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>*Nyuae the Cruel glances at you indifferently and then flashes a warm smile with sinister undertones. 'So, a base insect deigns to address me. Since you're lacking the proper etiquette, it would be fitting to repay your impudence with pain. But... you've caught me in one of my kinder moods so I'm going to let you live. Begone, before my mood changes.*
