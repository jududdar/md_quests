## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Oracle of K-Arnon says:** Greetings, Soandso, I am the Oracle of K'Aron. Do you quest for [knowledge] yourself, or do you offer that which I [seek].

**You say:** `knowledge`



>**Oracle of K-Arnon says:** I have lived long and have insight into many matters, yet I despise charity. To learn from me, you must first bring me that which I [seek].

**You say:** `seek`



>**Oracle of K-Arnon says:** I seek knowledge, which is superior to all things. And no knowledge is greater than that which is contained within the [Tome of Ages].

**You say:** `tome of ages`



>**Oracle of K-Arnon says:** The Tome of Ages has been compiled over the millennia by the Scribes of [Dal]. It was divided into seven distinct [books] by the scribes to keep the knowledge from one such as me. That said, with aid, I shall unite these books and the Tome of Ages shall be mine.

**You say:** `dal`



>**Oracle of K-Arnon says:** They were elves once, but now are Teir'Dal, and as evil as they are wise. Many tomes have they written, but none greater than the Tome of Ages.
