# Fendlemend Figlefop


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>*Fendlemend Figlefop sighs and looks up at you. 'What a horrible expedition! No goblin relics, not even some goblin dishes! My rebreather is broken and the only thing we [found] was not even from the goblinempires!'*

**You say:** `found`



>*Fendlemend Figlefop huffs for a moment, looking quite upset. 'I found a [silly sword blade]. It is useless to me. The only thing I study is goblins, and this thing is definitely not goblin insign.'*

**You say:** `silly sword blade`



>**Fendlemend Figlefop says:** You will have to ask Denken about the blade. I gave it to him to get it out of my way.

**You say:** `rebreather`



>**Fendlemend Figlefop says:** Our rebreathers are broken and I'm not sure how long it will take me to fix them.

**You say:** `denken`



>**Fendlemend Figlefop says:** Denken is my dwarven excavator.  He is taking a break while I try to fix our rebreathers.  You might try up the hill near those aviaks.  He has a tendency to fraternize with them
