# Denken Strongpick
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Denken Strongpick says:** Hello, Soandso. I am Denken Strongpick. I wish I could get off this rock, silly clan honor. My boss broke our rebreathers and we can not go back to the mainland before wegather some [goblin relics].

**You say:** `goblin relics`



>**Denken Strongpick says:** There are supposedly goblin ruins around here somewhere. Fendlemend thinks we will find paydirt underwater. We did find [one thing].

**You say:** `one thing`



>**Denken Strongpick says:**  We found a very fine sword blade. Denken pulls open his pack and shows you a razor sharp sword covered with runes. I can't figure out what type of metal it is and I sure can't figure out what technique was used to forge it. Perhaps you would like to take it off my hands and [buy] it?

**You say:** `buy`



>**Denken Strongpick says:** Out here, money is fairly useless to me. You see, I can't leave Fendlemend out here alone. I signed on with a very detailed contract. I could sure [use] a few things from the mainland though.

**You say:** `use`



>**Denken Strongpick says:** I would be willing to part with this very fine blade for a keg of Vox tail ale, a block of permafrost to keep it cool and two new rebreathers to get this operation back underway.
