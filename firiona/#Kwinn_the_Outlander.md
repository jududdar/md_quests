# Kwinn the Outlander
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Kwinn the Outlander says:** Hail, adventurer! Kwinn's the name. Hunting is my game. I have been all over this continent. Seen many things and found [odd trinkets]. I have no quarrel with any race. I judge a person or critter by their actions. Heck, my best friend is a troll!!

**You say:** `odd trinkets`



>**Kwinn the Outlander says:** Blast!! I found some strange thingamajigs!! Most of it I toss or sell to vendors and crazy sages. I am on my way to sell this [iron tail] to a tinkerer.

**You say:** `iron tail`



>**Kwinn the Outlander says:** Found the thing washed up on the shore in Timorous Deep. Looks like a metal lizardman tail. It is all rusted and covered with barnacles. Probably can't get much for it, but I'll try. Why do you ask? Are you looking to [trade for the mechanical thing]?

**You say:** `trade for the mechanical thing`



>*Kwinn the Outlander takes out an extra pack. 'Thought you might be interested. I don't want to take a loss and I only trade for things I am hunting, so here!! Inside this pack you need to combine the following items; a sabertooth tiger mane, a pair of pygmy brute choppers, a lime plume and a war bone fist. Return the full sack to me and the tail is yours.'*
