They are reputedly led by a powerful sorcerer, but of him I'm afraid I know nothing else. [General Veredeth] has left us strict orders to slay the beasts on sight.

**You say:** `general veredeth`

**You say:** `bloody kithicor`



>**Lieutenant Darakor says:** Surely you've heard about the battle of Bloody Kithicor! It was only a few years ago that the dark elves attempted to conquer Highkeep and from there all of Antonica. Legend has it they were led by the the daughter of Innoruuk herself, Lanys T'Vyl. It was only through the heroics of Firiona Vie and her companions that the threat was put to anin Kithicor Forest. Many brave souls were sent to Tunare that day when Innoruuk bestowed his wrath upon the battlefield.
