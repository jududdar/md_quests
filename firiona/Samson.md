# Samson
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>*Samson begins to stroke the nearby brew barrel.  'What will it be?   Me and Old Gertie here make the finest brew this side of the Timorous Deep.  Afraid I am the only one who is allowed to touch her - she's very special to me.  If you want to brew yourself, you can start looking for that [jungle city].'*


e.self:DoAnim(59);

**You say:** `jungle city`



>**Samson says:** I've heard adventurers talk of a city deep in the jungles. They say the dead walk its streets. Many have claimed to discover great treasures there as well as to lose many friends. I also heard it may have a working brew barrel.
