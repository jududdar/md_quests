## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Gearin Gaxx says:** Welcome. friend!  If armor is what you seek. let the house of Gaxx provide you with the finest.  Our metalwork is second to none.  Every now and again we may even create [rare armor] for the general public to purchase.


e.self:DoAnim(29);

**You say:** `rare armor?`



>**Gearin Gaxx says:** I have found many exotic materials in Kunark with which I can create rare armor.  I currently am working on the [Guard of Ik] and the [Hate Tail Guard] shields.  I have no armor as of yet. but I am experimenting with new designs.

**You say:** `guard of ik`



>**Gearin Gaxx says:** The Guards of Ik are made from shields found in the jungles.  I would be selling them if it were not for the unfortunate fact that the shields are spectral and vanish overnight.  Another bit of bad news is that the formula I was working on to stabilize the essence of the metal was stolen by local pirates.  I need two more shields and my formula.  Bring these to me and I shall not charge you.

**You say:** `hate tail guard`



>**Gearin Gaxx says:** I can create the Hate Tail Guard using both metal and scorpion carapaces. I have the metal. I will make you one for the price of 100 gold coins - I accept only gold. I will also need two flawless carapaces from giant hate tail scorpions.
