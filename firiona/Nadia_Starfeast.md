**You say:** `diamond`



>**Nadia Starfeast says:** Here is the diamond that I have prepared for you. Its only purpose is to trap the essence of a particular book worm. If you should fail in your first attempt, do not worry. I will provide you with another.

>*Nadia Starfeast jumps. Eeekk... a scorpion. I thought they rid this area of these critters. Those things give me the creepers. Take this emerald and be on your way.*
