>*Kaydin Gaxx smells of rust.  He sets down a chain of linked rings.  'Greetings!  Come looking for some protection from the beasts, eh?  Wise, indeed.  Kunark is a much more dangerous place than one might think.  And once you enter its dense jungle territories, you may not see civilization again for months.'*
