## Dialog

**You say:** `Stanos`



>**General V-ghera says:** Stanos? Stanos!! That dog, I WILL see him dead for what he cost me. Outcast I am, stripped of my position, my god has forsaken me, blaming ME for the loss of some tome. And you, Soandso, you have aided him. For that, you will die first. Please, struggle and beg, I do so enjoy watching my victims squirm, and I have little joy left in my life now. If you want my favor, perhaps if you came bearing Stanos' head I would be more forgiving. But I doubt it.

>**General V-ghera says:** Life is indeed sweet! Thank you, Soandso, you have done me a great service this day. Take this, Stanos was kind enough to return it to me, and I have no use for it now. Know that you have the blessing of Innoruuk for this deed! But of course, I leave it to you to leave here alive. A leader has to feed his minions, you know.
