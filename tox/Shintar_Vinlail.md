## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Shintar Vinlail says:** I have no time to answer questions. whelp!  Now. leave this place before the sting of death finds the life in your veins!

**You say:** `mission`



>**Shintar Vinlail says:** All right, already, if you must know! We were hunting down the escaped prisoner for the bounty. We tracked him here. We saw him take a boat downstream. Moohank and Binnlin grabbed a canoe and went after him. Being the weakest, I stayed behind to make sure the escapee did not backtrack. Of course Moohank and Binnlin will not be bested by one man, so I'm just waiting for their return. Now, will you just leave?!

**You say:** `moohank`



>**Shintar Vinlail says:** Moohank has the worst temper of any Erudite I know. To keep from going insane with anger, he started fishing constantly. He lives by a small pier on the other side of the stream. He and Binnlin are on a mission.

**You say:** `binnlin`



>**Shintar Vinlail says:** Binnlin is about seven feet tall and all muscle. He is very shy with a bad temper which frequently causes him to beat strangers to a pulp.


**You say:** `heretic`



>**Shintar Vinlail says:** I have no time to answer questions about those madmen!



**You say:** `prisoner`



>**Shintar Vinlail says:** Listen. That escaped prisoner is already out of this land. Don't waste your time looking for him any more. If you do, you willup dead like the others.



**You say:** `wait`



>**Shintar Vinlail says:** I am waiting for some old friends who are headed down the stream this way. I am sure you don't want to be here when they get here. They are a temperamental lot and hate new faces. Go home!
