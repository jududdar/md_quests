## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Elial Brook says:** Good day to you. This is a dangerous forest for adventuring. Watch out for the [beasts of these woods].

**You say:** `beast`



>**Elial Brook says:** These lands are most abundant in poisonous creatures. Watch your step. I have even heard tales of some seeing the dreaded [plague dragon], but I believe that to be sheer myth.

**You say:** `dragon`



>**Elial Brook says:** Like I told you, that is sheer myth. A great dragon whose breath can rot the flesh from your body in seconds?! Pfaw! This is surely another tale told by senile old men. Ha!!

**You say:** `heretic`



>**Elial Brook says:** Heretics!! Thank Quellious the High Guard Sentinels are around to keep us safe from those evildoers!


**You say:** `prisoner`



>**Elial Brook says:** There was an escaped prisoner named E'lial B'roon. He was supposed to be a crafty heretic from what I hear. Thank Quellious I have not met up with such an evil man. I shall watch my back for suspicious men such as that [magician in the forest].



**You say:** `magician`



>**Elial Brook says:** There is a magician running around on the other side of the stream.  I know because from time to time he comes to the stream.  He never fishes or gets water, he just stands there as he is if waiting for something.  He dropped something, a tunic.  Can you [return  the tunic] to him?



**You say:** `tunic`



>**Elial Brook says:** Oh, good.  Be careful!  He may be the heretic escapee.
