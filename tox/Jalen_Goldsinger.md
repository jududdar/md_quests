## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Jalen Goldsinger says:** A fine day.  Quite murky and quiet, is it not?  May your path be filled with fortunes.  Be well.

**You say:** `crystal`



>**Jalen Goldsinger says:** Hrm?  A crystal of capturing?  Aye.  I do know the secret of their making.  Not that I would tell you.  I will, however, create one for you.  Provided you bring some of their components and a large coin reserve, that is. I require a potion of sorrow and 1000 gold coins.  A tidy sum, in return for which, I will do you the favor of not asking why you need such a... dark item.

**You say:** `potion`



>**Jalen Goldsinger says:** An interesting little concoction.  Gorth Bearsoul is the only alchemist I know of who can make such an item.  Loud and quite smelly, he is.  Not unusual for a barbarian.  He calls the icy city of Halas home.
