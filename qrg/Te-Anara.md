# Te-Anara
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Te-Anara says:** Welcome, friend! I hope your stay in Surefall Glade will ease your mind and soothe your soul. While you are here, we ask you to abide by the [laws of the Jaggedpine].

**You say:** `jaggedpine`



>**Te-Anara says:** We ask that you do not start campfires on our land. Do not litter our land with any items. Do not chop down our pines or tread upon any foliage. Please do not take more than a bellyful of fish. Do not harm any other wildlife and stay clear of [the great bear]!

**You say:** `great bear`



>**Te-Anara says:** The great bear I speak of is Mammoth. He has lived among us for over a century. Tunare has truly blessed us with his presence. As long as Mammoth lives, so too does Surefall Glade. We are currently worried. Corun has reported that there is something [wrong with Mammoth].

**You say:** `wrong with mammoth`



>**Te-Anara says:** Mammoth is not eating. We believe something is lodged in his throat. We require a young druid to [fetch a special potion].

**You say:** `special potion`



if( **Faction is** > Indifferent) then 




>**Te-Anara says:** Go to the gnome city of Ak'Anon on the continent of Faydwer. With their great zoo, you will find a gnome named Kimble Nogflop. Give him this flask of nitrates and he shall hand you a special potion which will force Mammoth to cough up whatever may be stuck inside his throat. Be sure to show me what you find inside his throat upon your return.



**You receive:**  [Flask of Nitrates](/item/13945)


elseif( **Faction is** == Indifferent) then 



>**Te-Anara says:** We, the Jaggedpine Treefolk, appreciate the help you've given us in the past. But, we must trust you more before allowing you to handle such important matters.


else



>**Te-Anara says:** You are an enemy of the Jaggedpine Treefolk, this forest, and the residents of it. Begone, before I am forced to take drastic measures!


**You say:** `ralem`



>**Te-Anara says:** Ralem Christoff is one of the finest warriors to come out of the Jaggedpine.  He was born and raised to be a ranger.  He now serves Antonius Bayle as the Field Marshall of a roving patrol.  His quiet, calm exterior hides a tactical genius and ferocious combatant.

**You say:** `antonius`



>**Te-Anara says:** Antonius Bayle is a good man.  His rule of Qeynos has been most kind to our land as well.  We also provide the key elements of his long range patrol division.  Our own [Ralem Christoff] serves as Field Marshall for that division.

**You say:** `leader`



>**Te-Anara says:** The land of Surefall Glade is ruled by no single hand other than Tunare, but if guidance is what you seek, I would suggest you speak with Te\`Anara.  She is the head of the Jaggedpine Treefolk.  Otherwise, you could speak with Hager Sureshot of the Protectors of the Pine.

**You say:** `poacher`



>**Te-Anara says:** Poachers have been plaguing our land.  We do our best to stop them.  If you wish to join the fight, seek the masters of the Protectors of the Pine.

**You say:** `druid guild`



>**Te-Anara says:** The Jaggedpine Treefolk are the local druids.  The masters can be found here within the great tree.

**You say:** `forge`



>**Te-Anara says:** We have nothing like that here in Surefall Glade.  You must venture to Qeynos.

**You say:** `armor`



>**Te-Anara says:** Oftentimes you can find a traveling merchant in one of the nearby houses.  Other than that you would have to travel to Qeynos.

**You say:** `qeynos`



>**Te-Anara says:** The great city of Qeynos can be found by walking along the path outside of Surefall Glade.  Many of our rangers and druids serve alongside the Qeynos Guard when the need arises.

**You say:** `bank`



>**Te-Anara says:** There is no need for a vault among our people.  You could try the Qeynos Hold in Qeynos.

**You say:** `talym`



>**Te-Anara says:** Talym Shoontar is a wanted man.  He is a very infamous poacher.  Hager Sureshot has placed a bounty upon his head.

**You say:** `chanda`



>**Te-Anara says:** The entire Miller family are nothing more than scum.  It is they who entice poachers to continue with their slaughter so they can profit from the skins of the wildlife.


**You say:** `tunarbos`



>**Te-Anara says:** Long ago, centuries before the Combine Era even, there grew a great tree upon Norrath.  It stretched to the stars and was as wide as the span of Erud's Crossing.  From the roots of this tree sprung all the woodlands of Norrath.  An unknown force struck it down.  Some say it was the great dragon, Veeshan!  Whatever the force, the Great Tunarbos was shattered.  Lost forever.  Now the wood chips lie scattered across the face of Norrath.  To hold a shard of the Great Tunarbos is to hold the hand of Tunare.
