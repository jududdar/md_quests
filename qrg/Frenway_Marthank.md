# Frenway Marthank
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** Greetings. stranger. Please excuse my melancholy state.  I have had some [bad news] that has brought me great sorrow.

**You say:** `bayle list`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** The Bayle List is my property.  Return it to me if you have it.  There is no more I can say of the list, but if you have the note and refuse to return it, then I shall let it be known that you betray [Antonius Bayle] himself!

**You say:** `toe.* bayle list`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** The [Bayle List] is gone.  It lies inside the belly of that beast, [Mammoth].

**You say:** `mammoth`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** Mammoth is the great bear which inhabits the caves. It was he that swallowed my son whole. My son was using the scroll case as a play sword when Mammoth approached. I know you need the list but my vows as a Protector of the Pine forbid me to harm the bear. Help me ease my pain. Kill Mammoth and bring me his hide. You will find the list inside the beast.

**You say:** `bad news`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** My youngest son was devoured by a grizzly bear while playing near the caves. It was an unfortunate accident. The great bear was just protecting its territory. Now, could you please just leave me be? <sniff>

**You say:** `antonius`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** Antonius Bayle and I were childhood friends.  He entrusted me to watch over the list.  What the list is, was never explained to me.  It looks like gibberish.

**You say:** `leader`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** The land of Surefall Glade is ruled by no single hand other than Tunare, but if guidance is what you seek, I would suggest you speak with Te\`Anara.  She is the head of the Jaggedpine Treefolk.  Otherwise, you could speak with Hager Sureshot of the Protectors of the Pine.

**You say:** `poacher`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** Poachers have been plaguing our land.  We do our best to stop them.  If you wish to join the fight, seek the masters of the Protectors of the Pine.

**You say:** `druid guild`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** The Jaggedpine Treefolk are the local druids.  The masters can be found here within the great tree.

**You say:** `forge`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** We have nothing like that here in Surefall Glade.  You must venture to Qeynos.

**You say:** `armor`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** Oftentimes you can find a traveling merchant in one of the nearby houses.  Other than that you would have to travel to Qeynos.

**You say:** `qeynos`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** The great city of Qeynos can be found by walking along the path outside of Surefall Glade.  Many of our rangers and druids serve alongside the Qeynos Guard when the need arises.

**You say:** `bank`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** There is no need for a vault among our people.  You could try the Qeynos Hold in Qeynos.

**You say:** `talym`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** Talym Shoontar is a wanted man.  He is a very infamous poacher.  Hager Sureshot has placed a bounty upon his head.

**You say:** `chanda`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** The entire Miller family are nothing more than scum.  It is they who entice poachers to continue with their slaughter so they can profit from the skins of the wildlife.


**You say:** `tunarbos`



>**Frenway Marthank says:** Long ago, centuries before the Combine Era even, there grew a great tree upon Norrath.  It stretched to the stars and was as wide as the span of Erud's Crossing.  From the roots of this tree sprung all the woodlands of Norrath.  An unknown force struck it down.  Some say it was the great dragon, Veeshan!  Whatever the force, the Great Tunarbos was shattered.  Lost forever.  Now the wood chips lie scattered across the face of Norrath.  To hold a shard of the Great Tunarbos is to hold the hand of Tunare.
