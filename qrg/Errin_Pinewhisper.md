## Turn-Ins



local expansion_flag = eq.get_current_expansion();

if(expansion_flag >= 4.0 and  **You turn in:** <img style="background:url(/static/icons/blank_slot.gif);width:20px;height:20px;" src="/static/icons/item_982.png" alt="" /> <a

>**Errin Pinewhisper says:** It is a shame when human blood must be shed in the defense of our brother wolves and bears. I thank you for your dedication to the Jaggedpine Treefolk. Take this rusty pine scout sword and sharpen it in a forge with a sharpening stone. It may take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done return the sharpened sword to me with a gnoll fang and a large king snake skin and I will put the finishing touches on the weapon.
