## Dialog

**You say:** `leader`



>**Sallah says:** The land of Surefall Glade is ruled by no single hand other than Tunare, but if guidance is what you seek, I would suggest you speak with Te\`Anara.  She is the head of the Jaggedpine Treefolk.  Otherwise, you could speak with Hager Sureshot of the Protectors of the Pine.

**You say:** `poacher`



>**Sallah says:** Poachers have been plaguing our land.  We do our best to stop them.  If you wish to join the fight, seek the masters of the Protectors of the Pine.

**You say:** `mammoth`



>**Sallah says:** That information is best kept secret.

**You say:** `druid guild`



>**Sallah says:** The Jaggedpine Treefolk are the local druids.  The masters can be found here within the great tree.

**You say:** `forge`



>**Sallah says:** We have nothing like that here in Surefall Glade.  You must venture to Qeynos.

**You say:** `armor`



>**Sallah says:** Oftentimes you can find a traveling merchant in one of the nearby houses.  Other than that you would have to travel to Qeynos.

**You say:** `qeynos`



>**Sallah says:** The great city of Qeynos can be found by walking along the path outside of Surefall Glade.  Many of our rangers and druids serve alongside the Qeynos Guard when the need arises.

**You say:** `bank`



>**Sallah says:** There is no need for a vault among our people.  You could try the Qeynos Hold in Qeynos.

**You say:** `talym`



>**Sallah says:** Talym Shoontar is a wanted man.  He is a very infamous poacher.  Hager Sureshot has placed a bounty upon his head.

**You say:** `chanda`



>**Sallah says:** The entire Miller family are nothing more than scum.  It is they who entice poachers to continue with their slaughter so they can profit from the skins of the wildlife.





**You say:** `tunarbos`



>**Sallah says:** Long ago, centuries before the Combine Era even, there grew a great tree upon Norrath.  It stretched to the stars and was as wide as the span of Erud's Crossing.  From the roots of this tree sprung all the woodlands of Norrath.  An unknown force struck it down.  Some say it was the great dragon, Veeshan!  Whatever the force, the Great Tunarbos was shattered.  Lost forever.  Now the wood chips lie scattered across the face of Norrath.  To hold a shard of the Great Tunarbos is to hold the hand of Tunare.
