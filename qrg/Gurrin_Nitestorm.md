# Gurrin Nitestorm
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Gurrin Nitestorm says:** Greetings, traveler. I am Gurrin Nitestorm, priest of The Rainkeeper and blacksmith of the Jaggedpine. I am still somewhat lost in these foreign lands and although my excitement to be reunited with our kin and brethren of the Jaggedpine Tree Folk is very much alive, I cannot help but long for my home. Aaaah, but [duty] calls and I must do what I can to aid both forces that equally strive to keep the sacred lands safe from harm and corruption.

**You say:** `duty`



e.self:Say("Beyond my sacred duties as a priest of The Rainkeeper and a warder of nature, my artisan skill as a blacksmith has been found to be of great use in these fledgling days of our reunion. The residents of the glade and the Knights of Thunder have found my skills to be of great use, and furthermore, I have had the distinct pleasure of learning the blessed ways of the Rainkeeper's faithful of the Qeynos region. Truly, it has been a remarkable experience and consider myself blessed to have this opportunity to be among my kin. My only regret is that the circumstances under which we have been spurned into this reunification of our culture are not ones of joyous regard 

**You say:** `barricade`



>**Gurrin Nitestorm says:** In the time when Antonious III guided Qeynos politically and morally, he saw the coming of the dawn of turmoil and sought to preserve all he could of his kingdom and people from the inevitable darkness to enshroud Norrath. The residents of the glade and Jaggedpine alike pleaded to his majesty, asking that the sacred lands of The Rainkeeper's faithful be among the lands spared exposure to the coming shadow of corruption. Knowing the plea of the Jaggedpine Tree Folk to seal themselves indefinitely from their beloved and sacred homeland was not one made lightly or without grievous consideration, his late majesty obliged his subjects' request and a barricade of stone, iron, and magic was constructed on eitherof the forest's boundaries.

**You say:** `guide`



>**Gurrin Nitestorm says:** Indeed, my friend. It seems that Kaithys has chosen you to do so and I shall do what I can to abide by his wishes. I would advise that you return to Kaithys and show him the purified blade. He knows much better than I what stones must now be overturned for his intentions of you to be properly fulfilled.
