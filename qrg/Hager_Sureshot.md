## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** Greetings, Soandso.  Feel free to rest here in Surefall Glade.  Just be sure you do no hunting whilst here.  If so, then you shall pay the punishment of death.  I trust you [will abide by the laws]?

**You say:** `abide by the laws`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** That is wise.  Your health, for now, is assured.  A plague of hunters has infested our land heavily in recent weeks.  The word is out that [Mammoth] still lives.  Hunters have flocked here in search of a trophy or profit and glory.  Instead, they find the deadly accuracy of my arrows.

**You say:** `mammoth`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** Mammoth is the great bear of the caves.  [Tunare] has blessed our home with Mammoth's presence.  It is said that when the great bear dies, so too shall the Jaggedpine.  He would be quite a trophy to some hunter.  And quite profitable to a poacher. Even the infamous [Talym Shoontar] has tried his hand at the hunt.

**You say:** `tunare`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** What?  You do not know the name of the Mother of All?!  Creator of all that grows green?!  It is She whose mana flows throughout all glades and forests.  As do our [brothers to the east], we bow before Her glory, swearing to protect Her creations and the denizens who call them home.

**You say:** `talym shoontar`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** Talym Shoontar is a poacher.  He has eluded us for quite some time.  He has organized parties of poachers to plague our forest as well as others.  He hails from Halas, but I have heard he now calls the Plains of Karana home.  I have placed a bounty upon his head.  Do you [wish to collect the bounty]?

**You say:** `wish to collect.* bounty`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** That's the spirit!!  Spoken like a true Protector of the Pine!  Last I heard, Talym Shoontar was hunting in the Plains of Karana.  He has also been spotted running to and from Qeynos.  No doubt he is selling hides to some merchant.  End his life of hunting.  Bring me his head to collect the bounty.

**You say:** `brothers to the east`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** Not brothers of race, but in heart.  The good elves of the Faydarks on the continent of Faydwer are the ones I mean. Both our communities respect the fact that peace and harmony can be found within Tunare's glory.

**You say:** `leader`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** The land of Surefall Glade is ruled by no single hand other than Tunare, but if guidance is what you seek, I would suggest you speak with Te\`Anara.  She is the head of the Jaggedpine Treefolk.  Otherwise, you could speak with Hager Sureshot of the Protectors of the Pine.

**You say:** `poacher`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** Poachers have been plaguing our land.  We do our best to stop them.  If you wish to join the fight, seek the masters of the Protectors of the Pine.

**You say:** `druid guild`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** The Jaggedpine Treefolk are the local druids.  The masters can be found here within the great tree.

**You say:** `forge`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** We have nothing like that here in Surefall Glade.  You must venture to Qeynos.

**You say:** `armor`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** Oftentimes you can find a traveling merchant in one of the nearby houses.  Other than that you would have to travel to Qeynos.

**You say:** `qeynos`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** The great city of Qeynos can be found by walking along the path outside of Surefall Glade.  Many of our rangers and druids serve alongside the Qeynos Guard when the need arises.

**You say:** `bank`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** There is no need for a vault among our people.  You could try the Qeynos Hold in Qeynos.

**You say:** `chanda`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** The entire Miller family are nothing more than scum.  It is they who entice poachers to continue with their slaughter so they can profit from the skins of the wildlife.


**You say:** `tunarbos`



>**Hager Sureshot says:** Long ago, centuries before the Combine Era even, there grew a great tree upon Norrath.  It stretched to the stars and was as wide as the span of Erud's Crossing.  From the roots of this tree sprung all the woodlands of Norrath.  An unknown force struck it down.  Some say it was the great dragon, Veeshan!  Whatever the force, the Great Tunarbos was shattered.  Lost forever.  Now the wood chips lie scattered across the face of Norrath.  To hold a shard of the Great Tunarbos is to hold the hand of Tunare.
