>**Royal Scribe Kaavin says:** Hello there, as the official Royal Scribe of Dain Frostreaver IV, it is my duty to pen, NO . . . WAIT. . . write. NO . . . I mean scribe, yes that's the word I'm looking for. I scribe the thoughts of the Dain for posterity. I currently have record books with a combined 11,982 pages of notes detailing the life and business of our present Dain. You see, I have a rather bad memory, so I write everything down. My latest entry is that on this day Soandso came and talked to me. Anyhow, I'm sure you have much better things to do than talk to me, so good luck in your ventures, Soandso, and come visit me any time.
