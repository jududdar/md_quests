## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Councilor Darakor says:** Hmmph, if you've come here to actually get something accomplished yer wastin yer time. This lot'll babble on endlessly about politics and luxuries. Only the Dain and a few others like myself want to deal with the actual problems of the Coldain, that being the bloody Kromrif of course.
