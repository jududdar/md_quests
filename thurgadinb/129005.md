## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**129005 says:** By Brell's black beard, ye startled me! So, it seems you have survived the dangers of the pit like we did. At first we thought it a blessing, but now we know that it is the curse of our dishonor.

**You say:** `dishonor`



>**129005 says:** It hurts me still to speak of it, but I shall try. The three of us were banished from holy Thurgadin and cast into the pit for crimes we did commit. I myself was guilty of trading gems to the Kromrif. I thought nothing of it at the time save that they paid well. If only I had known back then, if only I wasn't so foolish.
