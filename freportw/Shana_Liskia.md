Once you are [ready to begin] I will present you with your Enchanted Sewing Kit.

When you are ready to attempt a specific piece you must tell me what piece you [want] to craft. For example if you had intent on crafting a cap you would say. [I want to craft a cap]. I can offer you the recipes for Arcane Scientists [Caps], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Sandals], [Trousers], [Gloves] and [Robes]. I must also suggest that you attempt your robe last due to the difficult nature of collecting the correct components.

The officer that took it was named Teridsan. If you should find him you have my permission to kill him if that's what it takes to get my necklace back. Return to me when you have my necklace along with 2 Lion Teeth.
