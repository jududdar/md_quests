**You say:** `shrine of innoruuk`



>**Sir Lucan D-Lere says:** It is about time Pietro sent someone. You people should be lucky I allow you to conduct your business in this city. I will have you all locked up if you cannot be more prompt. Now, listen up! I want you to go out to the Commonlands. My guards have reported that a messenger from Qeynos is staying at an inn near the western edge of the Commonlands. I suspect he is carrying vital information to the Hall of Truth. I want him stopped. Bring me the message if you know what's good for you and the Dismal Rage. Now, get out of here!

## Turn-Ins




if( **You turn in:** [A Note](/item/18822)) then


>**Sir Lucan D-Lere says:** So I see you decided to bring me the message. Good. I would hate to have to hunt you down. It could have gotten really messy and I hate reading bloodstained messages. Well it seems Antonius Bayle and the Knights of Truth have begun an alliance. And it sounds as though I may have a traitor among my guards. If you wish to switch your allegiance to Freeport, then find me this traitor. Bring me his militia tunic. Try to keep the blood from staining it.
