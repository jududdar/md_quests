>**Ulia Yovar says:** Greetings Soandso. If you have love and kindness in your heart then seek refuge at the Temple of Marr and the Hall of Honor in North Freeport. There is a growing evil spreading through the city. May Erollisi save us and cleanse this city of the hatred and corruption spread by the vile Dismal Rage.
