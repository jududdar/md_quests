>**Klom Jysun says:** Pleasure to meet you Soandso. I am Klom Jysun, Grandmaster of the Ashen Order. I have lived in the great city of Freeport for quite sometime now and have watched the city evolve and change. Nowadays though I am in charge of training new members of the Ashen Fist. If you are a young monk and are in need of some armor I might have some work for you. Are you a [monk]?


**You say:** `monk`




>**Klom Jysun says:** I am always pleased when a new disciple visits our sacred halls. If you are [interested] in crafting your own armor I have a number of gathering tasks for you to do that will test both your navigational and fighting skills.


**You say:** `interested`




>**Klom Jysun says:** I am very pleased to hear about your interest in proving your worth to the Ashen Order. First let me present you with this Fistfighters Sewing Kit. Inside of it you will combine [various components] to form armor materials. Once you have a material for a certain piece of armor you will combine it in a Loom along with the appropriate pattern. When you inform me what piece of armor you [want] to craft. I will be able to present you with the component recipe and pattern needed for crafting it.

**You say:** `various components`




>**Klom Jysun says:** The items you will need to collect are all over the Freeport area, some in stores some off vicious monsters. If you are up for the challenge though I will be able to provide you with the armor recipes and patterns for Stonehand [Cap], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Sandals], [Trousers], [Gloves] and [Robes]. All you will need to do is tell me what piece of armor you [want to craft], and I will be able to present you with the component recipe and pattern needed for crafting it.


**You say:** `cap`




>**Klom Jysun says:** A cap will almost certainly be your most important piece of armor you will craft. To create your cap material you will need to combine 2 Matted Lion Pelts, 1 Malachite, 1 Snake Scales and a Cloth Cap in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a Loom along with this pattern to fashion your very own Cap of the Stonehand.

**You say:** `bracer`




>**Klom Jysun says:** In the case that you are not able to dodge a blow from an attacker a solid wristband will prevent you from getting seriously hurt.

Once you have created the proper material take it to a Loom along with this pattern to fashion your very own Bracer of the Stonehand.

**You say:** `sleeve`

**You say:** `trouser`




>**Klom Jysun says:** Trousers are a definite must for any Initiate of the Ashen Fist.

**You say:** `robe`




>**Klom Jysun says:** Your robe is essential to your armor set and I am very pleased to hear that you are ready to craft it. To create your robe material you will need to combine 5 Matted Lion Pelts, 1 High Quality Cat Pelt, 1 Lion Mane, 1 Leaf Scarab Carapace, 1 Giant Scarab Brain and 1 Cloth Shirt in your assembly kit.

**You say:** `favor`




>**Klom Jysun says:** I had a student not too long ago that trained with me for quite sometime. He showed a lot of promise on his way to becoming a Grandmaster, however one day he came to tell me that he intended on joining the militia. I told him that I did not feel that was what he wanted to do but he insisted. On the day that he left he stole a headband from me that I was presented with by the Hall of Truth. This headband meant a lot to me, if you were able to find Firansad I am sure he will have it. Return it to me with two Orc Toes and I will surely reward you for your trouble.
