>**Samatansyn Flamecaller says:** It is a pleasure to meet you Soandso, I am Samatansyn Flamecaller, Warder of Tunare and Guildmaster of Faydarks Champions. I have studied here for many of my years until recently when I took up teaching. I have many pupils that undergo my vigorous [training exercises].


**You say:** `training exercises`




>**Samatansyn Flamecaller says:** I have a series of tests that all new rangers of Kelethin are suggested to participate in. These tests will help you develop many of your skills including hunting and gathering and will also provide you with a chance to fashion your own Trueshot Chainmail. If you are a [ranger of Tunare] and are willing to begin your training I will be happy to explain to you how the tests work.


**You say:** `ranger of tunare`




>**Samatansyn Flamecaller says:** Excellent Soandso, then lets get started! Here is your Trueshot Assembly Kit. You will collect various items from the Faydark and Clan Crushbone that will be necessary for creating your armor materials in your assembly kit. Once you have fashioned together a specific armor material you can then take it to a forge along with the applicable pattern to create your Trueshot Chainmail armor piece. Simply tell me what armor piece you [want] to craft and I can provide you with the material recipes and patterns for Trueshot Chainmail [Coifs], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Boots], [Legplates], [Gauntlets] and [Tunics].
