The vile beast did not stick around for it knew they could not best me in combat. Therefore I had no chance to retrieve my lute or to seek revenge.  Will you retrieve my lute for me Soandso?

>**Sarialiyn Tranquilsong says:** Fantastic Soandso. please return to me when you have found my lute. I also ask that you bring me 2 Orc Jawbones to prove that you are united with us in our war against the vile orcs. I hope to see you soon.
