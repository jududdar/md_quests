>**Davloran Girionlis says:** Good day Soandso. I am Davloran Girionlis Holy Knight in service to the Prime Healer Rodcet Nife. I pride myself on being responsible for ridding my homeland of unimaginable evil during my fighting days. Nowadays I just like to train new Temple of Life paladin [recruits].


**You say:** `recruit`




>**Davloran Girionlis says:** We have a number of new recruits entering our guild hall every single day. For this reason I have developed a set of exercises that test the hunting and gathering skils of all young paladins. If you are a [Paladin of Rodcet] I might be able to present these tests to you as well.


**You say:** `paladin of rodcet`




>**Davloran Girionlis says:** Fantastic Soandso, let me explain to you how the exercises work. You will combine a number of magical items that you will gather from our city and in the training areas and combine them in a Lightbringers Assembly Kit. Certain items used in certain quantities will combine into a specific armor material. These materials can then be taken with the appropriate mold to a forge and be combined together to create a piece of Lightbringers Armor. I can present you with the material recipes along with the correct armor molds for each armor piece once you are [ready to begin your exercises].


**You say:** `ready to begin`




>**Davloran Girionlis says:** Very well Soandso. Please take this Lightbringers Assembly Kit. When you are ready to gather the items for a specific armor piece you must only tell me what piece you want to craft. I can provide you with the recipes and armor molds for Lightbringers Platemail [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates].

**You say:** `job`




>**Davloran Girionlis says:** I have been working for quite some time at my blacksmithing skills in my spare time. My initial interest was to make armor for our new recruits. However. after I discovered these armor recipes there has been more of a need for weaponry rather then armor. I have began to construct weapons suitable for all those that pass the training exercises but I have run short on supplies. I need someone to [gather the necessary supplies] for me.


**You say:** `necessary supplies`




>**Davloran Girionlis says:** That's great news Soandso, I applaud your willingness to help me gather these items. I would go get them myself but I must always be available here should any of the other newcomers need my help. Please collect 2 Flawless Gnoll Hides and 2 Wisp Essences for me and I will do my best to fashion you a weapon together for your trouble.
