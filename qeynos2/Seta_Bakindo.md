>**Seta Bakindo says:** Ah... Welcome friend. I am Master Seta, of the Silent Fist Clan. We know that true strength lies inside your soul. Once you have found and mastered it, your fists will be deadlier than any blade.


**You say:** `problem`




>**Seta Bakindo says:** There have been numerous muggings lately in Qeynos by corrupt guards. These guards are sworn to protect, server and uphold law in the city but all the do is break the law ten fold themselves. These corrupt individuals must be stopped. I have a [Silent Fist clan member] that I feel may be in trouble.


**You say:** `silent fist clan member`




>**Seta Bakindo says:** Konem Matse is my friend and mentor, he resides in Qeynos Hills providing security for the Sayers there. Lately though I have heard reports of guards demanding he pay them tax or else. This tax they speak of does not exist. I need you to go to the hills and help Konem. Rid the lands of these corrupt guards and bring me their heads as proof. I will also need 1 High Quality Gnoll Fur for a tailoring project I have been working on. Return to me with these items and you will be rewarded for your troubles.

We need you to find him, if he is still alive. Tell him that Seta has sent you to find him, and escort him back to our guild. Good luck.

>**Seta Bakindo says:** I pride myself on passing some of the finest monks in all of the lands through my testing halls.

When you are [ready to begin the tests] I will present you with your Silent Fist Assembly Kit and explain to you how the tests work.


**You say:** `ready`




>**Seta Bakindo says:** Be mindful of your surroundings Soandso, it is here in Qeynos and in the adventuring areas surround it that you will find all the necessary items for creating Armor of the Silent Fist.

These magical armor materials can then be combined in a loom with a magical pattern to create different Armor of the Silent Fist pieces. When you are ready to collect the items for a specific armor piece please tell me what armor piece you want to craft. I can present you with the patterns for Silent Fist [Cap], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Sandals], [Trousers], [Gloves] and [Robes].
