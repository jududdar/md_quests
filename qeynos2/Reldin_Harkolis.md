**You say:** `hail`




>**Reldin Harkolis says:** Hail Soandso. Know that only within these few passageways and rooms whose borders are marked by the symbol of the Circle of Unseen Hands can we speak freely of our organization and its undertakings. Neither the streets of the city above nor the sewers and catacombs are free of ears that would harm the Circle of Unseen Hands should they hear of our [secrets].


**You say:** `secret`




>**Reldin Harkolis says:** The Circle has many secrets some of which only Hans may know. Our agents are all about, mingling among the common law abiding folk and working in all manner of profession. At one time we had a significant number of the Qeynos Guard allied to our organization but the loyal soldiers of Antonius Bayle IV has discovered and punished many of them. The ones that remain are hesitant at best to continue their association with us. You will need to exercise much caution within this city as you learn the ropes. I will help get you outfitted in some [gear] that you will find useful in our line of work.


**You say:** `gear`




>**Reldin Harkolis says:** Take this Curing Kit. With it you can assemble an outfit of light, flexible, and sturdy yet inconspicuous leather clothing to protect you from the perils of your job. The materials required will depend on the piece of clothing you desire to craft. Do you plan on crafting Sturdy Workmans [Gloves], Sturdy Workmans [Boots], a Sturdy Workmans [Bracer], a Sturdy Workmans [Cap], Sturdy Workmans [Leggings], Sturdy Workmans [Sleeves], or a Sturdy Workmans [Tunic]? Once you are suitably outfitted return to me and I will inform you of your [next job].

Bring it back to me when you have done so.

local expansion_flag = eq.get_current_expansion();

>**Reldin Harkolis says:** Excellent! It is fortunate you recovered this message in time. Take this Rusty Unseen Hands Dagger to a forge and sharpen it with a sharpening stone. It may take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is accomplished bring me the sharpened dagger, a gnoll fang, and a large king snake skin and I will put the finishing touches on the weapon for you.
