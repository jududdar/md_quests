**You say:** `hail`



>**Guard Simkin says:** Heh?  Soandso, huh?  What do you want?  Can't you see I am a busy man, guarding and protecting you weaklings..  er.. citizens?  You better just move along before something happens to you!

**You say:** `gnoll`



>**Guard Simkin says:** Blast those dogs!  The Sabertooths is what they call themselves around here.  They have a nest, or whatever you call it, up there east of Surefall Glade.  We can always use help here, keeping those dirty gnolls away from our fine city.  Talk to Captain Tillin in South Qeynos and tell him you want to join the fight.

**You say:** `weapon`



>**Guard Simkin says:** This city has been blessed with the craftsmanship of the Ironforges.  Their weapons are supreme.  Their shop can be found near the Temple of Life in North Qeynos.  You may also try the local warrior guild.

**You say:** `order of the three`



>**Guard Simkin says:** The Order of Three consists of the three positive circles of the arcane known as magic, enchantment and wizardry.  This guild keeps very busy in its hall near the arena.  All in Qeynos respect their powers.

**You say:** `monk guild`

**You say:** `circle.* unseen hand`



>**Guard Simkin says:** The Circle of the Unseen Hand?  I have heard nothing of them.  Are they some sort of performing magic troupe?

**You say:** `paladin guild`



>**Guard Simkin says:** Within Qeynos are the Knights of Thunder and the Priests of Life.  Both of these orders consist of clerics and paladins and are respected by all.  The Hall of Thunder lies in South Qeynos and the Temple of Life is in North Qeynos.

**You say:** `necromancer guild`



>**Guard Simkin says:** What gibberish are you spouting?  There is not, nor will there ever be, such an organization as that within a hundred miles of Qeynos, not with the Qeynos Guard on patrol.  Next you will be inquiring of a rogue guild!  Really!

**You say:** `ranger guild`




>**Guard Simkin says:** I believe you shall find the Protectors of the Pine and Jaggedpine Treefolk in the hollow of Surefall Glade.


**You say:** `jaggedpine treefolk`

**You say:** `linarius`



>**Guard Simkin says:** The Qeynos Tower Guards of the hills and plains are commanded by Captain Linarius Graffe.  He often has much to report.  He is posted in a keep which spans a river.  I believe it is in the northern Plains of Karana.

>**Guard Simkin says:** The passages to North Qeynos can be found near the bard's guild or next to the Clock of Ak'Anon.

**You say:** `inn`

**You say:** `antonius`



>**Guard Simkin says:** Antonius Bayle is the ruler of Qeynos. He is such a great man that they renamed this continent after him. He brought Qeynos to the glory it now is. He formed the mightest army on Norrath, the Qeynos Guard. It is through his guidance that we shall protect all nations of Antonica from any evil threat. He does not venture into the city streets often. He is quite busy.

**You say:** `tillin`



>**Guard Simkin says:** Captain Tillin Brightblade is the commander of the Qeynos City Guard. Extermination of the Sabertooths is his paramount concern. He has recently begun to hire mercenaries to assist in the extermination. If you wish to help out then go and speak with him. He is most often found discussing tactics with Ebon Strongbear at arena.
