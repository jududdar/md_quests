**You say:** `hail`



>**Faldor Hendrys says:** What do you want?! Can't you see I am busy drinking here? You don't even look like you belong here. You can have my seat when I am good and ready to leave, which won't be for a while yet. If I were you, I would get lost before I got myself hurt.

**You say:** `tunare`



>**Faldor Hendrys says:** Listen, buddy!  I do NOT know what you are babbling about!  If you know what's good for you, then you'd best leave.
