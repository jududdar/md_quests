## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Brohan Ironforge says:** Please, leave me be alone. I have such [sorrow] in my heart... I wish to be alone with my thoughts.

**You say:** `sorrow`



>**Brohan Ironforge says:** My [daughter] [Tayla] has left and I fear she will not return. If only I could find someone... Hey, would you like to [do a favor] for an old man or are you [too busy]?

**You say:** `daughter`



>**Brohan Ironforge says:** Tayla is my oldest and youngest daughter. Unlike the rest she is of a different mother. She is part elven. She appears to be physicaly younger than the rest, but she has spent more years as my daughter than all the others. Tayla is from my first marriage to [Weleana].

**You say:** `tayla`



>**Brohan Ironforge says:** My daughters have informed me that Tayla has runaway to live with the elves of Kelethin. Apparently life among the human citizens of Qeynos was not very kind to her. I wish her well, but I wish I knew she was safe.

**You say:** `hurrieta`



>**Brohan Ironforge says:** Hurrieta is a good woman. She has a bit repulsed that I once was married to a wood elf. She got over that I believe. We had four children together. The children seem quite accepting of Tayla, even though she is a half elf.

**You say:** `favor`



>**Brohan Ironforge says:** Good. Please find my daughter, Tayla Ironforge. Bring me proof that she is safe. She was last seen near Nektulos. I am a fine blacksmith and I shall give you a worthy gift if you do this for me.

**You say:** `too busy`



>**Brohan Ironforge says:** I understand. Adventurers have nothing more to worry about than themselves.


**You say:** `weleana`



>**Brohan Ironforge says:** Weleana was my first wife. She was the most beautiful creature I have ever seen. We had a daughter, Tayla. We were quite happy. Unfortunately, on one of her frequent trips to the Jaggedpine, she was attacked by a bear of enormous strength and even with all her talent as a ranger, she was mauled to death. I thought I would never love again, but I was wrong. I met [Hurrieta].


**You say:** `ton`



>**Brohan Ironforge says:** That man Ton Firepride is quite the braggart. He believes he's the finest of all blacksmiths.
