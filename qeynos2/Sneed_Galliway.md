**You say:** `problem`



>**Sneed Galliway says:** Shhh.. Keep it down. It seems I have a little rodent problem in my store. A mangy rat keeps digging into my crates of rations. He looks as if he is diseased. If you help me by killing this pest, I will make it worth your while. Bring me his head as proof it is done.

**You say:** `ronn castekin`



>**Sneed Galliway says:** Ronn? I saw him a few days ago. He was with someone dressed in black I didn't recognize .. I think I saw them later that day, swimming in the north pond. They really should stay away from the aqueducts. They can be quite dangerous. Full of rats, ya know.
