## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Suuspa Clanim says:** Welcome to the Temple of Life, Soandso. It is here that you may pay tribute to the [Prime Healer]. Does not your heart beat with the sound of life?  It is He who makes it so. Do not let the hand of [Bertoxxulous] and his [new disease] lay upon your soul or, like so many, you shall meet your fate at theof my sword!

**You say:** `Bertoxxulous`



>**Suuspa Clanim says:** The one who spawned all the diseases and imperfections of the lands of Norrath. Do not seek his wisdom, for there is none. Do not become part of his [new disease].

**You say:** `new disease`



>**Suuspa Clanim says:** The new disease I speak of is called the [Bloodsabers]. They are the loyal followers of Bertoxxulous and as such have been condemned by our temple. Do you wish to [join the fight]?

**You say:** `Bloodsabers`



>**Suuspa Clanim says:** If I knew where they were, there would be no reason to employ your talents. They would be extinct!

**You say:** `join the fight`



if **Faction** >= Indifferent then



>**Suuspa Clanim says:** Then seek out those who worship the Plaguebringer.  End their threat!  Each member has upon them the mark of the Bloodsabers, a [rat-shaped ring]. I shall reward all those who return such rings to me.

>**Suuspa Clanim says:** Your mere presence disgusts me. Please remove yourself from my sight. Until you change yourself and your ways, you are unwelcome in the Temple of Life.





**You say:** `rat-shaped ring`



>**Suuspa Clanim says:** A rat-shaped ring, you say? That is the sign of the [new disease].

**You say:** `Prime Healer`



>**Suuspa Clanim says:** He is the sustainer of life. The hand which supports us when we begin to slow down. Rodcet Nife, the Prime Healer! He is why we exist.



**You say:** `trintle.* attack`



>**Suuspa Clanim says:** Impossible!! What madness do you speak of!!? If he did he must have had a reason. Maybe Trintle had been tainted by the words of Bertoxxulous..?

**You say:** `heal`



>**Suuspa Clanim says:** I cannot help you with your request.   You must speak with Brother Tonmerk Plorsin.
