# Lieutenant Dagarok


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** How dare you disturb me! You people need to just mind your pathetic lives and leave the rest to us. Leave me now!

**You say:** `weleth`



>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** Guard Weleth?  What is there to tell about that coward?  He is inept and derelict in his duties.  If Commander Kane were in charge, soldiers like him would be chopped up and fed to the beetles.

**You say:** `weapon`



>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** This city has been blessed with the craftsmanship of the Ironforges.  Their weapons are supreme.  Their shop can be found near the Temple of Life in North Qeynos.  You may also try the local warrior guild.

**You say:** `order of the three`



>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** The Order of Three consists of the three positive circles of the arcane known as magic, enchantment and wizardry.  This guild keeps very busy in its hall near the arena.  All in Qeynos respect their powers.

**You say:** `monk guild`



>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** In North Qeynos sits the house of the Silent Fist Clan.  These monks are welcome in Qeynos and often assist in training the Qeynos Guard in hand to hand combat.

**You say:** `bank`



>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** Qeynos Hold in South Qeynos is just across from the arena.  You know, over the bridge behind Firepride's.

**You say:** `port`



>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** The port of Qeynos is located in South Qeynos.  From here one may catch the ship to Erudin.

**You say:** `kane`



>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** Commander Kane Bayle is the commander of all the Qeynos Guard.  He is second only to his brother, Antonius Bayle.  His post is in the guard house at the city gates.  Mind you, do not bother him, he has a bit of a temper.

**You say:** `circle.* unseen hand`



>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** The Circle of the Unseen Hand?  I have heard nothing of them.  Are they some sort of performing magic troupe?

**You say:** `paladin guild`



>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** Within Qeynos are the Knights of Thunder and the Priests of Life.  Both of these orders consist of clerics and paladins and are respected by all.  The Hall of Thunder lies in South Qeynos and the Temple of Life is in North Qeynos.

**You say:** `necromancer guild`



>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** What gibberish are you spouting?  There is not, nor will there ever be, such an organization as that within a hundred miles of Qeynos, not with the Qeynos Guard on patrol.  Next you will be inquiring of a rogue guild!  Really!

**You say:** `ranger guild`




>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** I believe you shall find the Protectors of the Pine and Jaggedpine Treefolk in the hollow of Surefall Glade.


**You say:** `jaggedpine treefolk`



>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** In Surefall Glade there are druids called the Jaggedpine Treefolk.  These men and women often assist our army during times of war.

**You say:** `linarius`



>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** The Qeynos Tower Guards of the hills and plains are commanded by Captain Linarius Graffe.  He often has much to report.  He is posted in a keep which spans a river.  I believe it is in the northern Plains of Karana.

**You say:** `south qeynos`



>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** The passages to North Qeynos can be found near the bard's guild or next to the Clock of Ak'Anon.

**You say:** `inn`




>**Lieutenant Dagarok says:** If you need a place to rest, I highly recommend the Lion's Mane Inn and Tavern.  Poor adventurers all huddle together in one of the backrooms of Fish's.
