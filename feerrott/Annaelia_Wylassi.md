# Annaelia Wylassi


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Annaelia Wylassi says:** If you have nothing other than a hail to offer me you best move along, I need concentration to study these odd bones that I unearthed. Funny thing about them though, they seem to resonate a hum. Quite unusual, you probably aren't [interested] in that though.

**You say:** `interested`



>**Annaelia Wylassi says:** Are you? I didn't take you for a necromancer. I tried to reanimate these remains but due to the vibration it was too unstable and collapsed. I have given up trying to animate them. I would need more supplies if I were to try again. I am too busy with other research to care though. If you are so interested you could go fetch the supplies for me. I suspect the bone structure is of a human, so I would need a vial of human blood. A jade inlaid coffin would be needed to perform the ritual in. Also a vial of clear mana to bind the bones with strong magic, and an essence emerald to complete the ritual.

>**Annaelia Wylassi says:** I will now try the reanimation.' Streams of mana surround the bones but nothing happens. Annaelia looks annoyed. 'Worthless bones! Why do they hum like this? Grah, I don't care I have too much to study. You want them? Take them!
