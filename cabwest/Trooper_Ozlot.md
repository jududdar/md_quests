# Trooper Ozlot
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Trooper Ozlot says:** Hail, citizen! If it is a good time you are seeking, you should head toward the tavern. You can't miss it. There is only one. The emperor says we should spend most of our time training, not in revelry. We troopers try.

**You say:** `sign the restraining order`



>**Trooper Ozlot says:** I do not believe you were sent by the legion. You do not look as though you could squash a kitten or even a bug. If you truly were sent, then you should be able to hunt down a sabertooth kitten. Tell you what, you bring me two sabertooth kitten canines and the legion order and I shall believe you. Only then will I sign the order for you.
