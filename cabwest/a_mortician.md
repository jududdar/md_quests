**You say:** `mortar and pestle`

**You say:** `who.* king`

**You say:** `tower of death`




>**a mortician says:** The tower is the laboratory of the secluded Brood of Kotiz.  We supply them with many slaves for their dark experiments and rituals.  Its dark halls smell of rotted flesh from a multitude of creatures, even our own.  It is said there is an entire chamber filled with the blood of a million.  This is no place for a weak stomach.  And the Brood does not welcome visitors.
