# Nihilist Zeegarn

**You say:** `hail`



>**Nihilist Zeegarn says:** Mind yourself within Cabilis. We will not tolerate any mischief. If you don't heed my warnings, you may be sentenced to the pit of the Crusaders of Greenmist. You don't want that! Also, you should always wear your robe when entering these walls. You do have your Drape of the Brood, correct?

**You say:** `yes`



>**Nihilist Zeegarn says:** Very good. Please keep it on and bow before the will of the Cazic-Thule when entering these walls. Be off.

**You say:** `no`














>**Nihilist Zeegarn says:** What is this?' The Nihilist barks in disbelief. 'You have lost your drape? This is unacceptable! Take this note and report to the Toilmaster at once. Read it on the way and praise Cazic-Thule for any mercy that you may be granted!
