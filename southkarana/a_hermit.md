# a hermit
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**a hermit says:** Huh!? Leave now before my pets devour you!

**You say:** `sheet of music`



>**a hermit says:** So you seek the two song sheets? If you truly want them, you will help the cause of the Unkempt Druids. Otherwise, you would have to fight me for it. So, which will it be? Will you help the Unkempt Druids or will you fight me?

**You say:** `unkempt druids`



>**a hermit says:** The Unkempt Druids are the voices of the trees and the animals. We fight for the hunted prey and the vanishing forests. We are the true druids and rangers who fight for the preservation of nature. If humanoid lives must be sacrificed to meet this goal, then so be it!

**You say:** `will help`



>**a hermit says:** Wise decision. I ask you then, to go to the western plains of Karana. Seek a farmer called Linaya Sowlin. Bring me her heart. A heart for a song sheet. Fitting, don't you think?

**You say:** `flute`



>**a hermit says:** A flute, eh? I do have a flute I got from a bard named Cordelia. You can have it if you do me a favor.

**You say:** `favor`



>**a hermit says:** Oh!! Will you? Well then, go into the Plains of Karana and search for a man named Talym Shoontar. He is a murderer of Norrath's creatures. He must be stopped! Bring me his head and you shall have your flute.

**You say:** `kill you`



>**a hermit says:** So be it! Fool!


**a hermit attacks you.**

**You say:** `join the unkempt`



>**a hermit says:** Then please wait outside for Master Jale Phlintoes. He will be arriving soon.
