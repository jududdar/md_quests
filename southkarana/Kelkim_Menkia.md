# Kelkim Menkia




## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>*Kelkim Menkia sighs as she looks over her lute. 'My lute was mangled by those damnable gnolls. I have no idea how I'm going to get a new set of strings for it. They were so rare.'*

**You say:** `rare`



>**Kelkim Menkia says:** I only use the finest lute strings on my lute. My uncle got them for me from across the world. His name was Zendrik the Wurmslayer. As his name implies, he killed many wurms and drakes. The strings for my lute were all made from the guts of the wurms and drakes he slew.

**You say:** `wurms and drakes`



>**Kelkim Menkia says:** The strings were from a chromodrac, a red wurm and a huge onyx drake. It always sounded so wonderful.' Kelkim sighs, looking off to the horizon. As she shakes her lute angrily, she says, 'I'll kill all of you dirty gnolls!
