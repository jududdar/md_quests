# Yeka Ias
## On NPC Spawn

**Set a timer** named *daydream* for 2700 seconds
## Timer(s)

>*Yeka Ias seems oblivious to the outside world. He stares into the water, chuckling every so often, as he drops in some sort of pebble that hisses for a moment on impact. His robes seem faded, tattered, and caked in dirt. A slight green shimmer surrounds his body.*
## Turn-Ins




if( **You turn in:** <img style="background:url(/static/icons/blank_slot.gif);width:20px;height:20px;" src="/static/icons/item_1003.png" alt="" /> <a

>*Yeka Ias grabs the heart as you toss it to him before realizing what it is. As soon as it touches his hands, his body convulses, a sickly light emanating from his eyes and oozing cracks appear in his skin. As he melts into the ground, a small glowing ball floats where he once stood.*
