# Yeka Ias
## On NPC Spawn

**Set a timer** named *daydream* for 2700 seconds
## Timer(s)

>*Yeka Ias seems oblivious to the outside world. He stares into the water, chuckling every so often, as he drops in some sort of pebble that hisses for a moment on impact. His robes seem faded, tattered, and caked in dirt. A slight green shimmer surrounds his body.*
## Turn-Ins




if **You turn in:** [Warm Pulsing Treant Heart](/item/20695)


>*Yeka Ias grabs the heart as you toss it to him before realizing what it is. As soon as it touches his hands, his body convulses, a sickly light emanating from his eyes and oozing cracks appear in his skin. As he melts into the ground, a small glowing ball floats where he once stood.*


 **You receive:**  [Cleansed Spirit of Antonica](/item/20698) (+2000 exp)


**Yeka Ias despawns.**

**This NPC *should* return incorrect items given.**
