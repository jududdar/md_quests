## Turn-Ins




if **You turn in:** [A love letter (Sealed)](/item/20876)


>**Ganelorn Oast says:** Ah, what do we have here? A letter? Hmm? Scented with a familiar fragrance too. You must have gotten this from Lily. I do wish I had more time to spend with her, for she is a very sweet girl. If she trusts you to deliver such a letter, I must ask you to do me a favor for me. Please take these eggs. They are a very rare species of albino rattlesnakes which were thought to have been extinct due to poachers who eat them as a delicacy and griffins which prey on them. If these eggs hatch there is hope for the species. I need you to deliver them to my master, Kithicor.

elseif **You turn in:** [Symbol of Achievement](/item/20878)


>**Ganelorn Oast says:** This does speak highly of you, my friend, an award from Kithicor does not come easy. But I must see more of your skills before I can consider teaching you. Lily's brother Devin is my current pupil - I need you to gather some equipment for me so I can properly train him. I require the following items of you - a smoldering sash, an adamantine ring and a blade forged of electrum. I also need a favor. Take this credit slip to Aanina Rockfinder. She is a merchant from whom I purchased a gift for Lily; it should be ready by now.

>**Ganelorn Oast says:** You have done well. I sense the one I have been hunting in the distance. As your final test, you must track him down and destroy him.
