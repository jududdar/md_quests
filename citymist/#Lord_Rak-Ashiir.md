>*Lord Rak-Ashiir looks down at the tear in his hand and says 'A minion of my god came to me one night. I knew it was of Cazic-Thule as I was frozen in terror. My mind screamed for me to flee but my body would not respond. The being took my daughter and vanished to only he knew where. When I regained control of my body and thoughts, I felt nothing but betrayal. I don't care anymore about anything. If you want repentance then slay me, Soandso.*
