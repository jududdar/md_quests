>**Scout Malom says:** Thank you for coming. I am surprised that you were able to find me. I barely know where I am at this point. I followed the vile beast that has been corrupting the spirits, but he eluded me after I followed him to that ridge up there.

Use levitation to work your way up the falls and return to me with the totem that you will acquire from releasing the spirit.
