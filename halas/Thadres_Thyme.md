# Thadres Thyme


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Thadres Thyme says:** Hello. Soandso!  It's hard to believe just how cold it gets here!  It really has been wearing me down. Especially after the [journey] from Qeynos.

**You say:** `what journey`



>**Thadres Thyme says:** I have been traveling the face of Norrath to unravel the mystery of why my beloved [brother] attacked a group of traveling bards.  He didn't survive the fight.  It's been so long. I can't really remember what he looked like!  I miss him so much...  Now all I have are his [diary] and some brewing recipes he sold before his death.

**You say:** `brother`



>**Thadres Thyme says:** My brother was Delius Thyme. I think he was a great man. Soandso, have you ever lost someone close? I don't know if I can ever forgive myself for letting him travel on his own after his sanity began to fade. Oh, Delius, please forgive me!

**You say:** `what diary`



>**Thadres Thyme says:** The diary?  It's one of the two connections I still have to my brother.  Sadly. [pages] are missing from it.  I've been looking for them.

**You say:** `what pages`



>**Thadres Thyme says:** I believe the pages contain the events that drove my brother to insanity.  I have been searching for the remaining three missing pages.  There is some hope; I found a couple of pages over in Everfrost Mountains.
