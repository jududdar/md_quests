# Hoyce MacTaegan


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Hoyce MacTaegan says:** Greetings to you brother. Did [Keven] send you?

**You say:** `keven`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then 



>**Hoyce MacTaegan says:** Very well, then let us begin. We are at home in the wilderness and thus it is important that we learn all we can about our surroundings. Now is the time of your learning. You are to venture out, hunt and learn about Everfrost. Return to me with a White Wolf Skin as proof of your successful hunt. We will then continue your training.


else



>**Hoyce MacTaegan says:** Hmmm... I don't know if I believe that.




**You say:** `the land`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then 



>**Hoyce MacTaegan says:** There is a bounty waiting for us in the wilderness for those with the wisdom to use it. Your next task is to find that wisdom within yourself and to use it. I shall task you with the creation of a few simple items from the materials available to us all. Go forth and harvest silk to make thread. Then when you feel you have learned enough, make a cap for yourself from the pelt of a bear. Return three Silk Thread and a Large Tattered Skullcap to me and I shall reward you.


else



>**Hoyce MacTaegan says:** Hmmm... I don't know if I believe that.




**You say:** `fight`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then 



>**Hoyce MacTaegan says:** That's the spirit! No doubt you know by now that our people are under constant attack by the goblins that infest our lands. Go out and fight against our enemies and bring justice to our people. Return to me with four Goblin Ice Necklaces and you shall have your just reward.


else



>**Hoyce MacTaegan says:** Hmmm... I don't know if I believe that.




**You say:** `challenge`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then 



>**Hoyce MacTaegan says:** Your zeal for justice is indeed a virtue. You make us all proud. Very well, venture out and into the home of those accursed dogs. Go to Blackburrow the home of the gnolls. There you are to fight against them and to retrieve the weapons of our mortal enemies. Return to me with a Gnoll Fang, a Giant Snake Fang and a Hunting Bow. I shall give you a weapon suitable for one such as yourself.


else



>**Hoyce MacTaegan says:** Hmmm... I don't know if I believe that.




**You say:** `favor`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then 



>**Hoyce MacTaegan says:** I thank you for your willingness to help. Many of our people hunt the mighty mammoth and the cougar out in the vast and frigid plains. Aside from the risk of injury that often comes from hunting such fearsome and mighty creatures, there is the added risk of being attacked by the terrible snow orcs. Go and protect our people hunting in the plains of Everfrost, fight against the snow orc and return to me with a Wrath Orc Wristband. Surely the spirits will forever guide you.
