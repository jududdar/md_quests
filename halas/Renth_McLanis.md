# Renth McLanis


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Renth McLanis says:** Hail, Soandso! Have ye come to train?  I train all warriors. All Wolves o' the North must be strong warriors and swift as well. Are ye a young wolf, then? If so, maybe ye can [assist Renth] with his wee problem, eh?

**You say:** `dangerous matter`



>**Renth McLanis says:** A murder was done in Halas recently. A couple were killed by a pair o' rogues fer a mere pouch o' copper. The shaman gave chase and the main rogue, Paglan, fell beneath an ice floe. One got away. We must [hunt the murderer]. Will ye help?

**You say:** `hunt the murderer`



>**Renth McLanis says:** Twas good old Dok whose brother and wife were slain. Speak with him at his shop. Ask him if he has [any information about the crime]. Return the head of the murderer and I'll give ye a [Langseax].

**You say:** `langseax`



>**Renth McLanis says:** The Langseax was crafted to be wielded by a warrior only.  Tis a one-handed slashing weapon with great balance to assist the warrior who masters it.

**You say:** `assist`



>**Renth McLanis says:** I was ordered by Kylan O'Danos to personally escort a young warrior sent to fetch the remains of his cousin, Ivan McMannus. I forgot and spent me greater time testing out the fine spirits. Now I must find the courier and the remains. Will ye [search fer the courier]?

**You say:** `the courier`



>**Renth McLanis says:** Thank ye, Soandso! Go to Everfrost Peaks and seek out Arnis McLish. Ask him where Megan, the courier, is. Once ye find Megan, would ye ask her where Ivan's remains are? Please go, at once!

**You say:** `dangerous matter`



>**Renth McLanis says:** The Wolves o' the North show ye no ill will, but there's much ye must do t' earn our trust.  Perhaps ye should speak with Lysbith and inquire o' the [gnoll bounty].

**You say:** `assist`



>**Renth McLanis says:** Run while ye still can!! The Wolves o' the North will not tolerate yer presence!
end

>**Renth McLanis says:** Good work!! Kylan will never know o' me negligence. I owe ye one, young warrior. Let's call it even with this. Twas found by one of our foraging parties. It is still useful. And... I believe ye can assist with a more [dangerous matter] as well
