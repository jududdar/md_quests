## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Teria O-Danos says:** Good day to ye! Ye look a wee bit hungrry. I sell many fine foods. Please have a look. Might I suggest the [lion roast]? It is a wee bit expensive, but well worth it.

**You say:** `lion roast`



>**Teria O-Danos says:** The lion roast is quite good. Tis me specialty. Ah marinate the lion meat in mammoth fat fer two days before roasting it. Lion meat isn't common around here. I'll purchase what I can from strangers but I rely mostly on shipments from the Plains o' Karana. I'm presently searching fer someone to [pick up me lion meat shipment].

**You say:** `lion meat shipment`



>**Teria O-Danos says:** It'd be grand o' ye to pick up me lion meat shipment. Ye must travel to the Plains o' Karana. Search fer a Northman fishing village. It should be Clan McMannus. Speak with the chieftain, Einhorst. Tell him ye're there to [pick up the lion meat shipment for Halas]. When ye return, I'll pay ye at least three gold. I look forward to yer return.

**You say:** `lion delight`



>**Teria O-Danos says:** Lion Delight is a trade secret and brings me much praise. I'll allow only one per customer. I'll also honor all as will [pick up the lion meat shipment] with a fine portion.
