# Daksins




## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Daksins says:** Hello traveller, what brings you to these cursed mountains? If I were you I would turn back now, all that really lies ahead of you is certain death. The vampires that inhabitant these mountains are some of the fiercest and most skilled.

**You say:** `return the extract`



>**Daksins says:** I suppose I could trust you to return it to Zimloro. You have earned my trust by going and slaying this beast for me. This will help me greatly as well as I must rest in Katta for a few days to recover from the wounds I received at the hands of these monsters. Please return this bag that contains the extract along with other components that Zimloro asked me to retrieve to him. Thank you, Soandso, I am forever in your debt.

>**Daksins says:** I see you were sent by my friends from back home. I understand that they are very worried about me but they must understand that I am doing this to help my sister and anyone else infected by this horrible beasts. If only I could receive some help in collecting a vampyre blood extract sample I could return it home along with the other components that Zimloro decribes in this letter.
