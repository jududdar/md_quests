# Kerzar Clawtore


## On NPC Spawn

**Set a timer** named *depop* for 300 seconds


## Dialog

**You say:** `valdanov`



>**Kerzar Clawtore says:** I have not seen Valdanov Zevfeer in many years. He came to me once when I was still newly reborn wanting to extract a vial of my blood.  When I refused he attacked me and extracted it against my will. I was still new and unfamiliar with my vampyric powers, Valdanov's [abilities] were far more developed than my own.

**You say:** `abilities`



>**Kerzar Clawtore says:** His vampyric abilities of course. Valdanov had either been reborn in undeath far before myself or had a powerful mentor and the time and facilities in which to train. I did my best to resist his attack but I was still subdued by his superior skills and strength. He dropped this key in the struggle. I have no use for it, consider it yours. I must be going before I'm seen by the others. Oh no! It's too late! We've been spotted! May you continue your investigations in the afterlife!


>*Kerzar Clawtore   rapidly transforms into swirling mist indistinguishable from the wind swept mountain fog as other forms begin to solidify from the fog nearby.*
