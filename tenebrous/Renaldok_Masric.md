**You say:** `hail`



if **Faction** >= Dubious then



>**Renaldok Masric says:** Greetings mortal. The aura of death that surrounds you is the only reason you are not already a feast for my minions. Have you come to me as a sacrifice or are you offering your [services] to the Coterie of the Eternal Night?


else



**Renaldok Masric says one of the following:**

>I didn't know Slime could speak common. Go back to the sewer before I lose my temper.

>Is that your BREATH, or did something die in here? Now go away!

>I wonder how much I could get for the tongue of a blithering fool? Leave before I decide to find out for myself.


**You say:** `services`



if **Faction** >= Dubious then



>**Renaldok Masric says:** If you are powerful enough to be of use to me you will journey to the Twilight regions on the south side of Luclin and fill this wineskin with the blood of Akheva. Failure is final death, either at the hands of the Akheva or the hands of the Coterie.
