## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Renux Herkanor says:** BOO! I'm sure you didn't expect to see me here, but you've left quite a trail. Why did you go to all the trouble to get this scrap of parchment? What can be so important about it that Father would risk all for it? No matter, Hanns will figure it out. Now, will you tell me where to find Stanos?

**You say:** `highpass hold`



>**Renux Herkanor says:** Excellent. Stanos shall meet his and soon. You, however, will not live another day. Can't have you warning him, now can I?


**Renux Herkanor attacks you.**
end



## On NPC Death

>**Renux Herkanor says:** Tell Hanns I tried, and will love him always. Tell Father I will save a seat in hell for him!
