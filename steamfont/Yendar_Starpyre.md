## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Yendar Starpyre says:** Hail, traveler! I sense you did not simply chance upon my isolation here, but are instead seeking me for something.

**You say:** `translate`



>**Yendar Starpyre says:** Oh, if it is written in Eder Teir'Dal, most likely I can translate it. I will be happy to try, in any case. Let me see it, please.

**You say:** `key`



>**Yendar Starpyre says:** In the Plane of Hate, where dwell Innoruuk and his minions, there is a tome. This tome is called the Book of Souls.

**You say:** `book of souls`



>**Yendar Starpyre says:** The Book of Souls chronicles all the lives Innoruuk has tainted over the years. It is in the care of the Maestro of Rancor. I can use this tome as a basis for my translation, if you return it and the note to me. An experienced practitioner in the art of non-detection should be able to snatch it from its resting place, don't you think, " .. e.other:Race() .. "?'

**You say:** `Eldreth sent me`



>**Yendar Starpyre says:** Eldreth, Eldreth, hmm, was that a rather shabby Erudite? I have dealt with him in the past, I am sure. What does he want of me?
end




## Turn-Ins





if( **You turn in:** <img style="background:url(/static/icons/blank_slot.gif);width:20px;height:20px;" src="/static/icons/item_868.png" alt="" /> <a

>**Yendar Starpyre says:** I say, this is indeed a challenge. This is written in what I'm sure is the language of the High Priesthood of Innoruuk. I've often wished I could read this, but I have never had the key to unlock the language. Take this for now.

>**Yendar Starpyre says:** My, this is quite a large list! Yes, I can use the names and dates recorded here to help me understand the script. It should be a simple matter now. A moment, please. Aha, yes, there we go. Translated as best I can! I do hope you're not involved in what is described here, as it is quite fiendish. Oi! You, woman! Give that back! Soandso, that woman there took your letter! I think I should leave you to discuss it with her. Best of luck!.
