# Hakon Brightsteel


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Hakon Brightsteel says:** Busy, busy, busy. Must get all these tools sharpened before the miners get cranky.

**You say:** `stonetooth`



>**Hakon Brightsteel says:** You spoke with old Stonetooth? Eeegads man! No one talks to 'im. Legend says he spent so much time down there that he eats nothin' but rocks now and drinks melted velium. Well I guess I should sharpen his axe, but I'll need some velium ore to repair it some. Bring me a chunk o' Velium Ore along with his axe and I'll get to work.
