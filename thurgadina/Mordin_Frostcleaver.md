## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Mordin Frostcleaver says:** Ah, allo there, and welcome to me shop, Soandso. Ye'll have to excuse the mess but I've been havin a bloody good time here lately. . . HAR HAR, ye get it? Anyways, thanks to you offlanders I now have a selection of some exotic meats never afore seen here on Velious.  I've been amazed at the demand for some of 'em.  I can't seem to keep shark meat in stock any more.  I wonder if eatin' raw fish is catching on?  In addition to supplyin' the freshest meat in Thurgadin I also offer tasks to would-be hunters in the wastes.

**You say:** `tasks`



>**Mordin Frostcleaver says:** Sorry, Soandso, but I've got no tasks to offer ye this week.  If ye be seriously lookin fer sumthin ta do ask ole Borannin 'bout duties fer the crown..

**You say:** `tundrabear sandwich`



>**Mordin Frostcleaver says:** Dat's easy, ye just take a slab o' dat Tundra Kodiak meat and a jug o' sauce, put it in da oven, den combine the product with a loaf o' bread in a mixin' bowl an' there ye be.

**You say:** `snow bunny stew`



>**Mordin Frostcleaver says:** Simple enuff, getcherself two hunksa Bunny meat and a jug o' sauces. Stir 'em in a mixin bowl, then put spices and two flasks o' water with it and cook it in a pot. Mmmm, zesty!

**You say:** `ulthork meat pie`



>**Mordin Frostcleaver says:** Hmm, lemme look that one up. Been a while since I made one. Here we are, two Ulthork meats, a vinegar and a spices in a mixin' bowl. Put yer meat mix, a clump o' dough, an' a pie tin in da oven an' yer good ta go.

**You say:** `snow griffin souffle`



>**Mordin Frostcleaver says:** This one's a bit tricky, ya toss four snow griffin eggs and a pack of spices in de oven. Ye must bake it just right or it's all gunna be wasted. When yer done bring it to Thoridain and if ye did it right he'll give ye his special seal. Just show Borannin that seal and yer shawl and he'll know that yer finished in the kitchen.
end
