**You say:** `hail`



>**Hunter Tarvin says:** Good day, stranger. I would love to sit and chat with you but I don't much like gabbing it up with total strangers. I have other things to think on, Good day.

**You say:** `thing`



>**Hunter Tarvin says:** Well, I am a hunter. I travel out over the wastes to the east and bring back hides and meat. The businesses pay me a bit of coin for what I bring back and I buy me a room at the inn for a little bit. Then I get low on cash and go back out into the wastes. Although lately I find myself out hunting more often than I stay in the city.

>**Hunter Tarvin says:** I hunt wolf and walrus meat. The city guard also pays me a small bounty for every gnoll pelt I bring in, but I rarely hunt gnolls. Bein' out in the wilderness, away from the politics and shortcomings of humanity, is my way of escapin' my own shortcomings. Hehehe, sometimes I think I might just decide to stay out there all the time until Brell beckons me. Well, now I'm babblin'.
