# an enslaved iksar


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>*an enslaved iksar looks up at you. You can tell his spirit is broken. His scars speak of a severe beating.*

**You say:** `Vok Na Zov`



>**an enslaved iksar says:** Forget them. I believe all six scrolls lie in the [Kaesora Library] and that is no safe place for any explorer. The scrolls are not readable by any livng person, but I came here in search of a machine which may be able to decipher them, the [Stupendous Contraption]. Should you return to Cabilis, see that the Arch Duke hears of the scrolls.

**You say:** `kaesora library`



>**an enslaved iksar says:** Oh!! You heard of the ancient library I discovered in Kaesora? I think the six scrolls of [Vok Na Zov] may lie there. I have not yet actually found the location of the library and it's very dangerous to lurk within the ruins of Kaesora. I would not venture there if I were you.

**You say:** `stupendous contraption`



>**an enslaved iksar says:** I have learned it was a machine tinkered by a legendary gnome. It has many uses. It lies in the slave pens of Droga. Perhaps it may be used to decipher the [Scrolls of Vok Na Zov]. I have leearned that it will not work without a [contraption needle]. Luckily I have found one in my journies.

**You say:** `contraption needle`



>**an enslaved iksar says:** The contraption needle is a piece of the machine, the [Stupendous Contraption]. It won't operate without it and if you want it, you're going to have to bring me the [pen keys].

**You say:** `pen keys`



>**an enslaved iksar says:** Pen keys!! I need the pen keys to get out of here! Find the ones who hold these keys. Bring me the key to pen number 1 and both keys to the pen gates. Do so and I shall give you the [contraption needle].
