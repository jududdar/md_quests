>**Scout Charisa says:** Ahhh the artifact, I will return this to Commander Leuz.  Please take this updated report to him ahead of me so he knows what to expect on my arrival.  Please accept this robe as a reward, I'm not very skilled at judging size so if you have a problem with wearing it please give it back and I will see what else I have for you.
