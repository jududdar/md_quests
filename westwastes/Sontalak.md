>**Sontalak says:** Why are you here, " .. e.other:Race() .. "? There is nothing you can gain from this land but an unsung death at the talons of your betters. If you want to prove your worth to Dragonkind, it will take more than slaying a few giants to accomplish it. Far more.

**You say:** `prove worth`

**You say:** `king is dead`



>**Sontalak says:** Yes, Soandso? You mean to tell me you have accomplished the task I set before you? Then it is proof I shall be having, or it is lunch I shall be having, do you understand?
