>**a forgotten traveler says:** Hello there, stranger. I see you've had the misfortune of winding up stranded like we have here. What's that you say? You're not stranded? Well, that's news to me, for sure! Maybe there's a way out of this wretched place. You'd let us know if there was one, right? Right?!




else





>**a forgotten traveler says:** Oh my, I haven't seen you here before. Are you one of the new unfortunate souls that has been shipwrecked? What's that? Oh, I see... you're here on your own accord, not because you are stranded. Well, hopefully you can do something about the storms outside.

>**a forgotten traveler says:** Graar! Who do you think you are sneaking up on me like that?! I'm sorry about that, I'm just a bit agitated with being stuck here like I am. I'm a mighty warrior, I should be out slaying beasts-a-plenty! Ah well, I don't suppose you have any word on the giants out yonder, do you? No? I thought not. I guess it's back to my dilegent cave watching.




else





>**a forgotten traveler says:** You haven't by chance had any luck outside the cave have you? We've been trying for so long to make some progress, but we just seem to get pushed right back into the cave. Well, if you have any status updates, be sure to let Askr know.

>**a forgotten traveler says:** How a scholar like myself came to be in a place like this is dumbfounding. Had I but known, I would never have gotten on that ill-fated sea cruiser. To think that there are not even any scrolls here for me to peruse, I need something before I go MAD!




else





>**a forgotten traveler says:** I feel so alone here in these damp, dark caves. My mother always told me that I'd lose myself if I didn't follow the old ways. I guess she was right, because here I am. Maybe if the Storms could be beaten, we would be able to scour this place for some way out. As it is, we're stuck here until someone can do that dirty work.

if(e.self:GetGender() == 0) then





>**a forgotten traveler says:** I can't imagine that the Storms were put here by Karana. It just doesn't make sense for him to cause so much havoc when he is so peaceful by nature.




else





>**a forgotten traveler says:** if only I had listened to the warnings. They said that there were storms here and not to come, but I didn't realize that the Storms were so aggressive. They even told me that there were several types of Storms, but I figured that if you've seen one, you've seen them all, right? Sigh...

else





>**a forgotten traveler says:** My brother was stranded here long ago. I tried to come to find him, but ended up just getting myself lost as well. Now I can't seem to find him; I fear the worst has happened to him.

if(e.self:GetGender() == 0) then





>**a forgotten traveler says:** What could you possibly be looking at? Hmm?! Mind your own business!




else





>**a forgotten traveler says:** The dreams, they come and go, but they're always the same. The eternal storm amidst the Storms; what could it mean? If only I could find out, I might be able to rest peacefully at night.

if(e.self:GetGender() == 0) then





>**a forgotten traveler says:** The Storms of the forest hide a secret. When the Storms have gone from the forest, the secret shall come out from the shadows to make itself known, or so they say.




else





>**a forgotten traveler says:** There is a mighty tree city not far from here, or so I have heard. I don't know who or what lives there, but there may be an answer as to how to get out of here within those trees.

>**a forgotten traveler says:** Hullo der, lass! Come te rescue us from the evil Storms, have ye?

>**a forgotten traveler says:** You, my friend, are a sight for sore eyes! I haven't seen anyone new in ages, and now... here you are! This brings me so much hope for my future. Now, if I could only figure out what I'm doing wrong with my key making, I might just find a way out of this place.

>**a forgotten traveler says:** Well hello there, cutie! It's so rare now days to see someone as strong and handsome as you around these parts. Most of the strangers that wash ashore stay in these caves and aren't much of a sight to look at. But you, you're different, and I like that. Take care of yourself, stranger.





else






>**a forgotten traveler says:** Well, look at you. You must think you're pretty special to be all the way in here trying to usurp my men! I'll have you know that I'm the best at what I do, and no little rat-faced, know-nothing is going to come between me and my men!

>**a forgotten traveler says:** Someone was saying something there being a new visitor to the caves, but I'm not sure who they were talking about.




else





>**a forgotten traveler says:** I've heard stories of a master of the mighty thunder that pours forth from the heavens. He plagues the trees with fire and destruction. Of course, I don't know if it's true or not, I haven't left the donfines of this cave since I was marooned here.

>**a forgotten traveler says:** I'm on lookout for any Storms, best leave me to my work.
