>**Glenda Melonfus says:** Hello there, Soandso. Did Kanthek send you to me?

**You say:** `yes`



>**Glenda Melonfus says:** Ahh, so you're interested in the Galorians then? Good to hear. The Galorians seem to be at war with the [Dawnhoppers]. The Galorians are known as the Sambata Tribe. I heard that they once lived in the caves behind us, but that all changed when the Dawnhoppers grew in numbers.

**You say:** `dawnhopper`



>**Glenda Melonfus says:** The Dawnhoppers are the rockhoppers who inhabited Dawnshroud. They are a cruel bunch of hoppers. I swear, if I didn't know any better I'd think that the hoppers were out to kill every last galorian they encountered. They don't like 'em very much.
