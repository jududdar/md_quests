# Dom K-Perl
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Dom K-Perl says:** Welcome to my little refuge of the mind. Here you may find passage to the grand worlds within a fine book. I have few books for sale, but any good book is rare in the realm of Norrath. On occasion, I even have [rare finds]. Be sure to use good lighting when reading. Strain the brain, not the eye, I always say.

**You say:** `rare finds`



>*Dom K-Perl starts rummaging through a pile of books and scrolls.*


>**Dom K-Perl says:** Oh yes, yes, yes. Rare books occasionally make their way to me. Ahhh!! I have one title, Before Green. Sounds like a bit of fiction. What would you like to [purchase]?

**You say:** `purchase`



>*Dom K-Perl puts on a monocle and begins to look over the book.*


>**Dom K-Perl says:** Hmmmm, Looks fairly valuable. In honor of the book's title, I shall allow you to trade for it with a fine emerald. What a bargain!

**You say:** `scribed tome pages`



>**Dom K-Perl says:** I can create a special magic scribed tome page. It has no words, but is not meant to be read. To create one, I will need some illweed parchment and my fee of 2 gold pieces. Once I have these, you may have one scribed tome page.

**You say:** `spectacle`



>**Dom K-Perl says:** My spare reading spectacles were stolen by froglok raiders in the swamps. I gave chase but the little buggers hop faster than I run. They were hopping with such fury that they dropped a [tome binder].

**You say:** `binder`



>**Dom K-Perl says:** I have a tome binder with the title 'The Origins of Pain'. Sounds like good reading, but it appears to be missing the pages it once held. If you want it, I shall give it to you for a bottle of blood ink from Cabilis and my spare reading spectacles.
