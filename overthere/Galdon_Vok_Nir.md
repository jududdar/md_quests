## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Galdon Vok Nir says:** Please do not harm me.  I am not the one who brought the outsiders to our land.  I am innocent and deserve to return to my people.

**You say:** `di nozok`



>*Galdon Vok Nir opens his eyes wide. 'Oh! You found one of my family's fine canopics. That particular one was made for the legendary mystic, Di Nozok. If you think you're going to open it, think again. I know how, and will gladly [open the Nozok canopic], for a price. I heard the second was stolen by a sarnak shaman.*

**You say:** `open.* canopic`



>**Galdon Vok Nir says:** Want it opened? I will need the two [keys of Dai], the Dai skull canopic, and my fee, 400 gold coins.

**You say:** `sealed`



>**Galdon Vok Nir says:** I have heard of such things. You must have stumbled upon an ancient jar devised by one of my long-dead ancestors. They were fine craftsmen. I do not share their gift, but I do know the secret of the locks. If you have one of the ancient Vok Nir canopics, allow me to open it for you.

**You say:** `key`



>**Galdon Vok Nir says:** There are two keys of Dai. They were made of ceramic and were also crafted to look like warrior totems. I once broke one as a child and my grandfather got very angry. He lashed me good! I do not know what the big fuss was about; he easily put them back together using some sort of clay.
