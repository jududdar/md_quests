# Modani Qu-Loni



## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Modani Qu-Loni says:** The hidden self inside a myriad of magic is one that walks quite softly. Yes, that is what you must seek.

**You say:** `ready`



>**Modani Qu-Loni says:** Scattered throughout the world are various items. To prove your worth, go collect these and return them to me. The Xolion Rod, Innoruuk's Word, Chalice of Kings, and snow blossoms.

**You say:** `chalice of kings`



>**Modani Qu-Loni says:** The Chalice of Kings is the chalice of elven kings. Previously thought to be lost to the ages, it was recently discovered. I need its magical powers to create a magical liquid.

**You say:** `xolion rod`



>**Modani Qu-Loni says:** This is the rod of an ancient civilization found on this continent. Nothing is known of it other than that the scaled ones discovered it years ago.

**You say:** `snow blossoms`



>**Modani Qu-Loni says:** These are flowers that are also used in the creation process. They were once widespread, but now I am told they only grow in select places.

**You say:** `innoruuks word`



>**Modani Qu-Loni says:** The strict doctrine of the priests of Innoruuk is used as a material component in the crafting. The power of their hate must not be underestimated.

**You say:** `sack`



>**Modani Qu-Loni says:** Before I provide the item, you must show me that you have spoken to Jeb.
