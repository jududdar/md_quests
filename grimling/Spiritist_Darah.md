## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Spiritist Darah says:** Hello, Soandso, welcome to the war zone. I probably don't have to mention that these are dangerous times here. I pray to the spirits that they might reveal to me the path to victory over our enemy. Recently, I have begun to feel that the answer to my pleas will present itself in the near future.

**You say:** `answer`



>**Spiritist Darah says:** I have been blessed with a recurring vision lately, one in which a hero will overcome our enemy. He then discovers the answer to a question that has plagued our people for a generation.

**You say:** `question`



>**Spiritist Darah says:** The vision gets very cloudy and I have yet to interpret that portion of it. I hesitate to speculate as there are many questions that remain unanswered since our displacement to this world.
