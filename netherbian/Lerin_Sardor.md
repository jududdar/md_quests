# Lerin Sardor
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Lerin Sardor says:** Ahh, hello there, Soandso.  I am a trader from Sanctus Seru trying to make my way to Shadowhaven for some dealings.  I have come this far with the aid of guards from Sanctus Seru, but they have turned back and left me to go on my own.  I hear there are many terrible [creatures] here lurking in the shadows, leave it to the guards of the Hand to leave me unprotected.

**You say:** `creatures`



>**Lerin Sardor says:** What I was told is that this pass is filled with small horrible creatures with no eyes.  Perhaps you could [help by providing safe passage] to the other side?

**You say:** `safe passage`



>**Lerin Sardor says:** Great!  If I can get safely to the other side I will give you a small trinket that I was going to sell.  Getting safe passage for the rest of my goods is worth more than the item in itself.  Surely you know a good deal when you hear one.  Take this note, if you agree to the conditions that I get across safely before you get payment return it to me and we will be on our way.


**You receive:**  [Unsigned Agreement](/item/5982)
