# Tomekeeper Bjordnessin
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Tomekeeper Bjordnessin says:** Greetings, weak one. What brings you to me? Are you just here to disturb me or do you have a question? Speak! You are using the King's time now, so spit it out... I have books that weigh more than you!

**You say:** `herb that harms dragon`



>**Tomekeeper Bjordnessin says:** An herb that harms dragons, you say? I do believe that I know of such a thing. I am a Tomekeeper after all... and we are very, very... um, very wise. The giant's brow furrows a bit as he thinks hard. 'Are you speaking of the dragonbane plant?' The giant asks.

**You say:** `dragonbane`



>**Tomekeeper Bjordnessin says:** The giant's face reddens as it shifts to a scowl. 'How did you hear about the existence of such an herb? Who sent you?', the giant growls.

**You say:** `sage`



>**Tomekeeper Bjordnessin says:** You say the Dragon Sage sent you, wretch? You have come here to mock me with a thousand year old legend? How do you plan to prove this absur... err... wild claim? It may be best that you show me some proof now, before I crush you!
