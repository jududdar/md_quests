## Timer(s)

>**Endric says:** Clean the [aqueducts] they tell me!  Peh.  I don't care how much they pay me, I am not climbing into that filth.
## Dialog

**You say:** `aqueducts`



>**Endric says:** Aye, the aqueducts are a horrible place. I have heard rumors of horrible [beasts] who live under the city in the water and just the other day, a child playing in the water just up and disappeared!

**You say:** `beasts`



>**Endric says:** I know nothing of what or where they may be, just rumors, friend. However, should you foolishly choose to enter the waters to brave the possibilities and return with some evidence of the [child's] fate, I would be most appreciative.

**You say:** `child`



>**Endric says:** The daughter of one of our own guardsmen is missing. He has offered me a reward for any information about her disappearance. So, if you find out anything, let me know and I will cut you in on the reward.
