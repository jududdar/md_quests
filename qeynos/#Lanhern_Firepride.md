## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Lanhern Firepride says:** Why, hello there!!  What is a powerful adventurer such as yourself doing in a dive like this?  I hope it is buying little ol' me a drink...?

**You say:** `donation.* temple.* thunder`



>**Lanhern Firepride says:** Yes, yes, yes.  We will talk about donations, but first, how about [offering a lonely woman a drink]?

**You say:** `offer.* drink`





>**Lanhern Firepride says:** I would love a drink. I prefer Ogre Swill. Just don't [ask what my sign is] or call me [beautiful].

**You say:** `sign`







>**Lanhern Firepride says:** How original. Why don't you take a long walk off the short Qeynos Pier?

**You say:** `superior armor`



>**Lanhern Firepride says:** Our forge skills were acquired from the armor lords of Kaladim, as were our [drinking skills].

**You say:** `drinking skill`



>**Lanhern Firepride says:** I learned the love of ale from the dwarves of Kaladim. Maybe someday I sall see you in the backroom at Fish's. If I do, don't forget to buy me an Ogre Swill.

**You say:** `husband`



>**Lanhern Firepride says:** My husband is quite adept in the art of smithing. We set up shop here but a season ago. We hope to one day be as successful as [Brohan] Ironforge.

**You say:** `brohan`



>**Lanhern Firepride says:** Brohan Ironforge is the owner of Ironforge's in the northern part of Qeynos. He seems to be a good man with good skills. He also has the honor of siring the most handsome man in Qeynos. [Dren] is certainly quite an exceptional man.


**You say:** `dren`



>**Lanhern Firepride says:** Dren Ironforge is only the most eligible bachelor in Qeynos! Not only has he graced this city with his good looks and charm, he will someday inherit the Ironforge Estate. What a catch he would be!
