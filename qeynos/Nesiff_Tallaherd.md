>**Nesiff Tallaherd says:** Tax time again already?? It seems like I just paid yesterday.. High taxes and low sales mean I won't be able to stay in business much longer. Good thing ol' Weleth is taking care of me. Here are my taxes.

## Turn-Ins





if **You turn in:** [Crate of Defective Arrows](/item/13925)


>**Nesiff Tallaherd says:** Oh dear. I hope my mistake will not bring too much grief down on poor Weleth. He was told not to order arrows from me after the last time I fouled up their shipment. But Weleth knew I needed the account to stay in business. Could you please rush this new invoice to him right away? Thank you.
