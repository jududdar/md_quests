# Ton Firepride
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Ton Firepride says:** Greetings, adventurer!  A mighty warrior such as yourself deserves only the finest in armor and we here at Firepride's were trained by the finest dwarven smiths.  We shall be branching out and crafting [other items] soon, also.

**You say:** `other items`



>**Ton Firepride says:** Well, soon I shall be showing my fantastic art in weapons making. I would hate to have the good people of Qeynos continue purchasing inferior weapons from that so-called blacksmith at [Ironforge Estates].

**You say:** `ironforge estate`



>**Ton Firepride says:** The Ironforge family has called Qeynos their own for far too long. He was never trained in the dwarven techniques as I was. He will not be cornering the weapons market very much longer.

**You say:** `tax`



* __Faction:__ [Corrupt Qeynos Guards](/faction/230) (-1)


>**Ton Firepride says:** Oh I see, Vicus has got some other sap to do his work. Fine. Here are your stinking taxes. If Kane were in charge, things would be different around here.


**You receive:**  [Fireprides Tax Payment](/item/13170)

**You say:** `lanhern`



>**Ton Firepride says:** Lanhern is a good woman, but she is not wise in the ways of the world. It is best she stays that way.

**You say:** `donate`



>**Ton Firepride says:** Away from me, fool! The Knights of Thunder are no friends of mine. They persist in forging their own armor! What?! Are not the talents of Ton Firepride to their liking?!
