# Sansa Nusk
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Sansa Nusk says:** Hello..  Welcome to the Wind Spirit's Song.  I'm Sansa, and I help out the local bards here.

**You say:** `lute`



>**Sansa Nusk says:** We carry many types of lutes and strings.  The bard guild here keeps us very busy.  And our customers, like [Fabian], keep us even busier.

**You say:** `fabian`



>**Sansa Nusk says:** Ahh - jolly Fabian. He is one of our best customers! That is, of course, due to the fact that he has the heaviest fingers of any bard I know. Anyhow, down to business. I assume he sent you for a new set of strings. Unfortunately, I have not been able to procure any of the special - uhh - things needed to make his strings lately.

**You say:** `special things`



>**Sansa Nusk says:** Uhh - ummm - uhhh - Fabian does not know this, but his strings are - uh - made of - uh - troll guts.

**You say:** `troll guts`



>**Sansa Nusk says:** Well, Fabian likes the thick resonance that only troll gut strings can provide. Trouble is, trolls are scarce around these parts, thank the gods, but Fabian breaks his strings as fast as I find suppliers. Trolls sometimes wander the Karanas in search of food but that is so rare, to see one there. Anyhow, if you find one out in the Karanas, bring me his gut along with 10 gold for materials and I can make the strings to take to Fabian.
