**You say:** `necromancer guild`



>**Guard Cyrillian says:** What gibberish are you spouting?  There is not, nor will there ever be, such an organization as that within a hundred miles of Qeynos, not with the Qeynos Guard on patrol.  Next you will be inquiring of a rogue guild!  Really!

>**Guard Cyrillian says:** If you need a place to rest, I highly recommend the Lion's Mane Inn and Tavern.  Poor adventurers all huddle together in one of the backrooms of Fish's.


**You say:** `antonius`



>**Guard Cyrillian says:** Antonius Bayle is the ruler of Qeynos. He is such a great man that they renamed this continent after him. He brought Qeynos to the glory it now is. He formed the mightest army on Norrath, the Qeynos Guard. It is through his guidance that we shall protect all nations of Antonica from any evil threat. He does not venture into the city streets often. He is quite busy.

**You say:** `tillin`



>**Guard Cyrillian says:** Captain Tillin Brightblade is the commander of the Qeynos City Guard. Extermination of the Sabertooths is his paramount concern. He has recently begun to hire mercenaries to assist in the extermination. If you wish to help out then go and speak with him. He is most often found discussing tactics with Ebon Strongbear at arena.

**You say:** `saber`



>**Guard Cyrillian says:** What was that you said? You mentioned the Sabertooths of Blackburrow? Those gnolls have caused this city trouble harm for too long. We have yet to force them from Qeynos Hills. I hear rumors of a few merchants who even dare to sell the outland Blackburrow Stout which is brewed by the gnolls. Foolish!! We call upon all citizens to assist in ridding our land of the gnolls. If you wish to join the fight then speak with Captain Tillin.
