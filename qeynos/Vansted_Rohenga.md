>**Vansted Rohenga says:** Pleased to meet you Soandso. I am Vansted Rohenga High Priest of Karana. I have spent all of my years studying the ways of the Cleric in our wonderful Temple of Thunder. We receive many new recruits every day and it is my duty to place them in my [training program].


**You say:** `training program`




>**Vansted Rohenga says:** Well all young clerics of Karana are brought up from their first day of training to know and respect their practice. I have developed a number of exercises that will enable a young cleric to make a set of their own armor by means of collecting certain items and making [enchanted armor materials] out of them.


**You say:** `enchanted armor materials`




>**Vansted Rohenga says:** Recently we have discovered that combing certain items in certain quantities using a magical assembly kit can forge together an armor material. These armor materials are used with specific armor molds to create a piece of enchanted Stormhealer Armor. If you would like to [begin forging armor materials] I will present you with your Stormhealers Assembly Kit.


**You say:** `begin forging armor materials`




>**Vansted Rohenga says:** Excellent Soandso, please take this Stormhealers Assembly Kit. It is in this kit that you will combine certain items together into materials necessary for crafting your armor. I can present you with the material recipes and armor molds for Stormhealer [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. When you are ready to gather the items for an armor piece simply tell me what piece you [want] to craft. Once you have created a specific material take it to a forge along with the applicable mold to create your armor piece.
