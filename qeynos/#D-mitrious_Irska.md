Well then, we cannot let an opportunity like this slip through our fingers, now can we?'' The mage quickly eyes the scroll before closing his eyes and beginning an arcane chant. The scroll in his hand begins to smolder, although the page is not damaged. A glowing silver image of a swirling storm seems to reflect off the surface of the parchment. Then, the scepter begins to slightly chime and runes begin to magically imbed themselves into the scepter's base. The mage opens his eyes and extends the scepter to you, ''Now then, [shall we continue]?
