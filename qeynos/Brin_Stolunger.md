**You say:** `spectator`

>**Brin Stolunger says:** I say!! Good show!! I see the look of the warrior in you. Some day you may be as great as Brin Stolunger. Ha!! Still, you are surely wet behind the ears. You will need to polish your skills. Take this sack. Return it to me when you have filled it with 5 bat wings and 5 snake scales. Be sure you combine the contents of the bag before you give it back to me. Now, be off!!
