**You say:** `hail`




>**Terren Starwatcher says:** Welcome friend! Have you come to the Temple of Tunare to give praise or are you a young Cleric seeking [guidance] from your elders?


**You say:** `further guidance`




>**Terren Starwatcher says:** If you are ready to put your life on the line for the citizens of our homeland than hear my words. The Crushbone Clan of Orcs are evil and strong adversaries of we Koada\`Dal. Recently an orc scout assaulted a merchant from our city carrying a valuable amulet from the Fier\`Dal city of Kelethin. Our seers have divined the name of the orc that is in possession of the amulet, Gurleg Bribgok. Find this despicable creature and return the amulet to me so that I may return it to its proper owner.


**You say:** `guidance`




>**Terren Starwatcher says:** Tunare shall be pleased to have a new disciple amongst her Koada\`Dal children. We Clerics of Tunare offer spiritual guidance to the citizens of Felwithe and when needed aid the Paladins of Tunare and the Keepers of the Art in the defense of our people and forest from those [creatures] that seek to cause us harm. Every young cleric should pursue acquiring a [suit of armor] to protect themselves when aiding those in need outside of the safety of Felwithes walls.


**You say:** `creatures`




>**Terren Starwatcher says:** There are many evil creatures in Norrath. Some are evil by nature, others have chosen evil by their devotion to evil deities. Even the Faydarks are not safe for young Koada\`Dal. The orcs of Clan Crushbone seek to expand their territory from their citadel to the north. The brownies viciously guard their hidden communities. pixies play mischievous and sometimes deadly pranks on travelers. and the arboreans have returned to the Faydarks after centuries of slumber.
