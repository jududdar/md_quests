>**Opal Leganyn says:** Welcome, good Soandso. We carry the finest in smithing supplies. Do you care to view my wares? Or have you come for instructions on how to craft a [Koada Dal Falchion]?

**You say:** `koada dal falchion`



>**Opal Leganyn says:** Koada'Dal Falchions are highly specialized weapons crafted of the finest mithril. The weapon must be forged in the unique Koada'Dal Forge and you will need a curved blade mold, a hilt and a pommel mold, some morning dew, and a folded sheet of mithril. If you are a faithful follower of the All Mother then you may craft a magical falchion using moonlight temper instead of the morning dew and forging an emerald imbued by a cleric into the weapon at the time of its creation.

**You say:** `wares`



>**Opal Leganyn says:** The various molds that I have for sale are used in the smithing of weapons. Simply use the necessary molds with a sheet of metal, a forge, and a water flask. Weapons with hilts and pommels will also need molds for those pieces and weapons such as pole-arms and axes require an oak shaft.
