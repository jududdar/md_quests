# Elia the Pure


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Elia the Pure says:** Hail to you, friend. If you require assistance, please ask, if not I must return to my tasks.

**You say:** `task`



>**Elia the Pure says:** It is here that the light shines brightest in our fair city. Here I sit, transcribing scrolls of luminescence. Spells to light the dark, to blind the evil with purity, or to heal those in pain. I find it so much easier to work with such spells if I am in the light itself.

**You say:** `purity`



>**Elia the Pure says:** Cleansing and such. Often our temple will cleanse evil. If you have need of such a thing, I can help. Merely let me examine the item.

**You say:** `assistance`



>**Elia the Pure says:** Our halls are nearby.  The priests are happy to bless you there.
