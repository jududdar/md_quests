**You say:** `hail`




>**Seria Woodwind says:** Hail friend. I am Seria Woodwind of the Royal Order of the Koada'Vie, the defenders of Felwithe. I assist young Koada'Dal that are called into Tunare's service as a paladin in learning the ways of the Koada'Vie so that one day they too may bear that noble title. Do you [wish to become a member] of the Koada'Vie?


**You say:** `become a member`




>**Seria Woodwind says:** As a defender of Felwithe you will be required to face much of the evil that inhabits the lands of Norrath. We do not sit idle and wait for the enemy to arrive at our gates before taking action towards the safety of our citizens. Every Koada'Vie initiate should acquire a [suit of armor] to aid in protecting themselves from the weapons of our [enemies].


**You say:** `enemies`




>**Seria Woodwind says:** There are sinister creatures in Norrath that threaten the safety and prosperity of the Koada'Dal. The Crushbone Clan of Orcs often emerge from their citadel to the North to murder and pillage the Fier'Dal and Koada'Dal, hoping to expand their territory into the Faydarks. The Arboreans, a species of destructive sentient weeds has returned from ages of slumbering beneath the soil of the Faydarks. Despite these evil forces that are close to our home the greatest threat to both the Koada'Dal and the Fier'Dal are the twisted and wicked Teir'Dal, the dark elf children of Innoruuk.


**You say:** `suit of armor`




>**Seria Woodwind says:** You require this special Mail Assembly Kit in order to fashion your Felwithe Defender's Armor. The materials necessary for the armor's construction vary according to the piece you are attempting to craft. Once you have been properly outfitted return to me and I will provide you with [further instruction]. Do you plan on crafting [Felwithe Defender Gauntlets], [Felwithe Defender Boots], an [Felwithe Defender Bracer]. an [Felwithe Defender Helm], [Felwithe Defender Greaves], [Felwithe Defender Vambraces], or an [Felwithe Defender Breastplate]?

We believe the spy can be lured out of hiding if his primary orc contact, a crushbone centurion by the name of Relgle, is eliminated on route to their rendezvous location. Find this Centurion Relgle, slay him for his crimes against the Koada\`Dal, then do the same to his Teir\`Dal ally. Bring me both their heads when the deed is done.

Once that is accomplished bring me the Sharp Felwithe Defenders Sword, a Pristine Forest Drakeling Scale, and an Arborean Amber and I will put the finishing touches on the weapon.
