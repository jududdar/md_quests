>**Rodrick Marslett says:** Are you searching for the rogue named Fenn Kaedrick? He used to be locked in here with me. That Lady McCabe bailed him out just minutes before the Teir'Dal planned to operate on him. He said that if I ever did escape, to venture to the very roof of this keep and wait till he showed up to escort me away from here.

**You say:** `princess`



>**Rodrick Marslett says:** Sshhh...  You know of the Princess Lenya Thex?! She is not that imposter in the cell down here! That one is a Teir'Dal assassin in disguise! I should know. I was one of the Princess' escorts. We were overtaken by Highpass guards.  All the escorts were used in Teir'Dal pain experiments. I am the last and I feel death at my door. The princess lives! She is somewhere in the keep. Find her and rescue her! Now, go, my friend!  Rescue the princess!

**You say:** `lady mccabe`



>**Rodrick Marslett says:** A stunning lady if I ever saw one. There is truly a rose missing from the gardens of Erudin. Just look, but do not touch. She is the spouse of Carson McCabe himself. How  even he won the heart of a lady as beautiful as that is an amazement to us all.

**You say:** `carson mccabe`



>**Rodrick Marslett says:** Carson McCabe is the ruler of Highpass Hold. It was his father, Sean McCabe, who established this great community.
