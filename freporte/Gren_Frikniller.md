**You say:** `rivervale`



>**Gren Frikniller says:** Rivervale?  Well, it's far from here, thank Fizzlethorpe.  They got more wanted posters with my face on 'em than they got trees there.  I mean, 'tweren't my fault either.  Just a friendly game of cards, and this little weasel catches me with an extra ace up my sleeve.  Can you believe this kid calls ol' Grenny here a cheater, right in front of the whole bar?!!  So, you know, I gave him a quick cut, ear to ear, with me dagger...  just to shut him up, you know.  Suddenly, I'm a murderer?  For simply defending myself?! Go figure!

**You say:** `elisi`



>**Gren Frikniller says:** Elisi runs the show around here.  She's usually a pretty busy lady.  Dang smart, too.  And it's my sworn duty to protect her at any cost, even with my very own life.
