**You say:** `hail`



>**Bronto Thudfoot says:** How ya doin', bub? Seein' as how you just joined the conversation, I think you need to buy us a round!



**You say:** `hail`



>**Bronto Thudfoot says:** I didn't know Slime could speak common. Go back to the sewer before I lose my temper.

**You say:** `blue beast`



>**Bronto Thudfoot says:** The Blue Beast is our ship. It is most likely the fastest ship sailing the seas of Norrath. It is a design all my own. Lenka says it is best to anchor it far from shore to keep the rogues from it.

**You say:** `Lenka`



>**Bronto Thudfoot says:** Lenka Stoutheart is my friend. She is of barbarian blood. If it were not for her, I would never have survived [Guk]. After Guk, we made a quick alliance and have traveled the world of Norrath aboard the [Blue Beast].

**You say:** `Guk`



>**Bronto Thudfoot says:** In the swamps of Innothule, you will find the kingdom of the frogloks, Guk. It was in Guk that Lenka and I met. Side by side, we fought the hordes of living frogloks to find a world of undead frogloks and much treasure.

**You say:** `rogue`



>**Bronto Thudfoot says:** I had quite a bit of grog that night and it was very dark. What I do remember was seeing a tall woman in a dress run from the docks. She sort of smelled, too. Like fish. I know it was the docks, but this woman had a real stench to her. Like dried fish baking in the sun. That is all I remember. It was too dark to see anything but her [silhouette].

**You say:** `silhouette`



>**Bronto Thudfoot says:** Yeah! The silhouette looked like a very brawny woman. It had to be a woman. The silhouette was surely that of one with a short skirt and long hair.
