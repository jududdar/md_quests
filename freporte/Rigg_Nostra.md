## Dialog

**You say:** `crate of pick head`



>**Rigg Nostra says:** I've heard that a dwarf who calls himself Grendig and has not registered with the Coalition of Tradefolk has recently arrived in Freeport and is staying at the Freeport Inn just inside the South Gate. He has brought to Freeport pick heads from his home city of Kaladim. Find Grendig and 'convince' him to 'donate' a crate of pick heads to the Coalition of Tradefolk as tax for peddling his wares in our city.

**You say:** `bundle of hardwood shaft`



>**Rigg Nostra says:** There is a halfling named Jimble Woodentoe that occasionally visits Freeport to peddle his woodcrafts. He can be found traveling through the Commonlands from the direction of Rivervale. Find Jimble and 'convince' him to donate a bundle of hardwood shafts to the Coalition of Tradefolk as tax for peddling his wares in our city.
