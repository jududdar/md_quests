## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Palatos Kynarn says:** What do you want?  Can't you see that I wish to be alone?!  I have no need nor desire to speak with anyone.  I have a minor dilemma to ponder and the only person I wish to speak with is the [captain].

**You say:** `captain`



>**Palatos Kynarn says:** If you have to ask that, you should not be in this fine establishment.

**You say:** `danaria sent me`



>**Palatos Kynarn says:** If you are working for Danaria, you have been misguided. You will go back to her empty handed. Now leave. The [captain] and I have some business to discuss.

**You say:** `portrait`



>**Palatos Kynarn says:** You have the portrait! Give it to me... <Hic!> Danaria will not get it...
end
