# Bryn Fynndel
## Dialog

**You say:** `morin sent me`



>**Bryn Fynndel says:** Morin Shadowbane, the great ranger, sent you to assist us?  A strong ranger you must be if he has sent you personally.  There is a great evil stalking the land, and it has spread its tendrils into Kithicor Forest.  We believe the [shadowed men] are involved with this, somehow.

**You say:** `shadowed men`



>**Bryn Fynndel says:** The shadowed men have recently begun to appear, with vile purposes unknown to us.  Their leader wanders these woods with a contingent of guards.  Bring us his code book, and we may learn more of their plans.
