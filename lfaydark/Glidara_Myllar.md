>**Glidara Myllar says:** So the ghoul boss knows of our inquiries?  I fear that villain not!  In fact, we must find out how much information he has received.  Invade the undead ruins nearby and retrieve his log.  Take this ring... it will protect you from his spells.  Return my ring with his log book and we will hopefully crack the mystery of Kithicor.
