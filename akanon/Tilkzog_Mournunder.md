>**Tilkzog Mournunder says:** Hail Soandso. I am Tilkzog Mournunder, Necromancer of the Dark Reflection. It is my duty here to assist not only the young necromancers of the Dark Reflection but also those wizards, magicians, and enchanters that have been called into the service of the Plague Bringer. I will aid you in obtaining an outfit of [durable clothing] suitable for a young sorcerer of the Dark Reflection. Once you have been adequately outfitted for venturing beyond our homeland in service of the Plague Bringer return to me and I will assist you in obtaining a [staff of dark reflections].


**You say:** `staff of dark reflections`

Many fear and oppose the beliefs that grant us our vision and powers. A wizard of the Eldrich Collective by the name of Winex Kloktik has been aiding members of the Deep Muses hunt and slay those loyal to Bertoxxulous and the Dark Reflection. Seek Winex Kloktik and eliminate her. When you have completed this task bring me Winex's Staff.

This gift enlightens us to the powers of disease, decay, death, and destruction. Forces that are misunderstood and feared by the majority of Norrath, including our fellow gnomes of Ak'Anon. These forces are the catalyst of change, cleansing Norrath of the old and weak, and we are the agents of this catalyst.
