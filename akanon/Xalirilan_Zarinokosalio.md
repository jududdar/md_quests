**You say:** `hail`




>**Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says:** Oi there! Its nice to meet you. You must excuse me for I am currently working on a special spell for my studies. I would love to talk but I have to teach a class very soon to the new [initiates] and I don't have my lesson prepared yet. Are you also a [young initiate of the Eldritch Collective]? If you are then I hope you will be ready for the lesson.


**You say:** `initiate`




>**Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says:** Excellent. You must understand that I am very pressed for time but if you are a young initiate of the Collective then I always have time to share my knowledge with you. If you are interested I have some [training] for you to begin. These tasks will help you prepare for the upcoming lesson as well!


**You say:** `training`




>**Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says:** I have a number of tasks that I ask new recruits of the Eldritch Collective to complete. These task will test both your ability to fight as well as your navigational skills, 2 very important factors on your road to infinite knowledge. When you are ready to begin your journeys I will present you with a Tinkered Sewing Kit that you will use to gather numerous [important components].


**You say:** `important components`




>**Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says:** All right then, here is your Tinkered Sewing Kit. In this sewing kit you will combine a number of recipes that will be used for creating your Eldritch Collective Initiate Armor. When you are ready to craft a certain armor piece all you must to is tell me which piece you [want] to craft. I will then present you with the component recipe along with the applicable pattern for [Caps], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Sandals], [Trousers], [Gloves] and [Robes]. When you have completed the material for whatever piece you asked for you will combine it in a sewing kit with the appropriate pattern to fashion your armor piece. I do suggest though that you attempt your robe last as the components are more difficult then any other piece to collect.

**You say:** `gloves`




>**Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says:** Its is very important that your hands are well guarded while you are attempting to practice magic because your hands will channel your energies thus having them injured would put a great burden on your training.

**You say:** `final tasks`




>**Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says:** Well I have been studying some new annals that were presented to me by some high councilmen in Rivervale. They had found them will excavating some ruins in the Gorge of King Xorbb and were unable to decipher what they meant. I had them bound in a special tome but unfortunately some pickpockets stole them from me in hopes that they would bring them great power I suppose. If you can find these 4 pages for me I would be very grateful for I would be able to finish my studies of them. Will you [seek out the stolen tome pages]?


**You say:** `seek out the stolen tome pages`




>**Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says:** I am very pleased to hear that you are willing to help and from your track record I have no doubt in my mind that you will be able to retrieve these pages. I would guess that they were given to the Dark Reflection casters for study after they were stolen from me so that would be where I would look. These casters do not understand our cause and serve dark gods so lethal force may be necessary. Just please be careful and make sure you have worthy adventuring partners with you because the battle may not be easy.


**You say:** `cap`




>**Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says:** A true initiate of the Eldritch Collective must always have a trusty cap on to protect any blows to the head.
