**You say:** `hail`




>**Iony Gredlong says:** It is very nice to meet you Soandso. I am Iony Gredlong Priestess of the Underfoot. I coordinate all the training for new clerics here in the Deep Musing. If you are a [cleric] then I might just have some tests for you that will challenge your wisdom as well as your fighting abilities.


**You say:** `cleric`




>**Iony Gredlong says:** Well you would certainly be eligible for my training then young Soandso. I have a number of armor recipes that I give to young clerics to make sure that when they leave the comfort of the Steamfont Mountains they are ready for whatever battles they may face. If you are [interested in creating your own armor] then all you must do is simply ask and I will give you instructions to get started.


**You say:** `interested in creating`




>**Iony Gredlong says:** I am always happy to see an eager young one like yourself! Brell certainly takes pride in all young gnomes that draw power from him to give life so you should consider yourself very special. To create your own armor you are going to collect [various items] from Ak\`Anon and Steamfont. You will then combine them in this assembly kit. Once you have made a material you will place it in a forge along with molds that I will present to you to create your armor.

When you are ready to attempt a specific piece please let me know what piece you want to [craft] and I will give you the necessary mold along with the recipe.

>**Iony Gredlong says:** Getting something on top of your head is a wise idea Soandso. To create your helm material you will need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 1 Rat Whisker, 1 Spiderling Silk and 1 Water Flask in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Shortnoble Platemail Helm

To create your breastplate material you will need to combine 5 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 1 Clockwork Spider Thorax Plate, 1 Brownie Parts, 1 Aviak Talon 1 Scrap Metal and the evil Halorniop\`s Insignia in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Shortnoble Platemail Breastplate.

**You say:** `final favor`




>**Iony Gredlong says:** I thank you for returning to me young Soandso. I must say that it is now quite clear that you are very capable of completing any task I should assign you due to your eagerness to learn. I am currently in need of a few specific items to craft a weapon worthy of any servant of Brell. It is my hope that I can pass these out to our new recruits quite soon. Will you [collect the items I require]?


**You say:** `collect the items`




>**Iony Gredlong says:** I need 3 Flawless Harpy Claws and 1 Ebon Drake Backbone still to have all the items necessary to craft this new mace. Once I have these items I can make a Shortnobles Walking Staff. For your trouble I will offer you my first staff made should I be able to create one. I hope to see you soon!
