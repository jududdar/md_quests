>**Iony Gredlong says:** It is very nice to meet you Soandso. I am Iony Gredlong Priestess of the Underfoot. I coordinate all the training for new clerics here in the Deep Musing. If you are a [cleric] then I might just have some tests for you that will challenge your wisdom as well as your fighting abilities.


**You say:** `cleric`




>**Iony Gredlong says:** Well you would certainly be eligible for my training then young Soandso. I have a number of armor recipes that I give to young clerics to make sure that when they leave the comfort of the Steamfont Mountains they are ready for whatever battles they may face. If you are [interested in creating your own armor] then all you must do is simply ask and I will give you instructions to get started.


**You say:** `interested in creating`




>**Iony Gredlong says:** I am always happy to see an eager young one like yourself! Brell certainly takes pride in all young gnomes that draw power from him to give life so you should consider yourself very special. To create your own armor you are going to collect [various items] from Ak\`Anon and Steamfont. You will then combine them in this assembly kit. Once you have made a material you will place it in a forge along with molds that I will present to you to create your armor.
