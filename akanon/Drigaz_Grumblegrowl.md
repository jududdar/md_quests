There is little I can tell you of the details of the kobold religion as I was rescued from death as a pup by the Deep Muses and reunited with Brell Serilis. What I know is this, the deity this symbol represents is named Rolfron Zek. He was a devoted shaman of Brell before the Abandonment, now he is the lord of Despair and Hopelessness. There is a shaman of Rolfron that teaches the local kobolds, he carries with him a doctrine. Recover the doctrine and take it with this translation scroll back to your Temple
