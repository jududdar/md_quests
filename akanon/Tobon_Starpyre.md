## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Tobon Starpyre says:** It is good to see the young show an interest in the ways of magic. Its circles can be used in tandem with our unique ways of tinkering. Have you [joined the Eldritch Collective] or are you [merely curious]?

**You say:** `joined the Eldritch Collective`



>**Tobon Starpyre says:** Very good. Would you like to [go on a little mission] or are you busy studying?

**You say:** `merely curious`



>**Tobon Starpyre says:** Please look around. We have much knowledge within these halls. May you soon find your place among our members. Good day.

**You say:** `go on a little mission`



>**Tobon Starpyre says:** Fabulous! Here is a list of the observers outside of Ak'Anon. Go and ask each for a [spare telescope lens]. Each should give you one. We have need of them. I await your return as does your reward, either Fire Bolt or Fingers of Fire. Meant for a skilled wizard of the eighth trial.


**You receive:**  [A List](/item/18868)


**You say:** `yendar`



>**Tobon Starpyre says:** Oh, he is my older brother. Used to be the leader of the Eldritch Collective. Then he founded the Observers, a pretty good piece of work. Went off his rocker a long while back, though. Became obsessed with Innoruuk and the Teir'Dal. Stays away for days at a time, nobody knows where he has been. Mother still worries about him, asked me to keep an eye on him. But he is a grown gnome, and with his mastery of the art, has little to fear in this world or others. But if you are seeking him, I would look outside Ak'Anon, in the Steamfonts. That is where he makes his home these days.
