## Dialog

**You say:** `are you mizzle`



>**Clockwork VIIX says:** Oh hello! I'm Mizzle, that I am. I bet you want to be given true clarity, don't you?

**You say:** `required component`



>**Clockwork VIIX says:** Then bring me a spoon, the one key, the lost scroll, and the book Charm and Sacrifice. I will then reward you with what you seek.

**You say:** `spoon`



>**Clockwork VIIX says:** Its a giant sized tool I will use to stir my magical pot. The spoon will help finish the ritual of crafting.

**You say:** `one key`



>**Clockwork VIIX says:** It is a key I lost long ago when I was travelling with a companion. We were traveling in the new lands flying over some large crevices when the key dropped out of my pocket.

**You say:** `lost scroll`



>**Clockwork VIIX says:** The lost scroll contains the magical incantation I need to help you out. It was penned ages ago by the Elves. It was lost along with its protector during one of the raids on the Outpost in Firiona. I fear it may be lost for good.

**You say:** `book of charm and sacrifice`



>**Clockwork VIIX says:** Oh, that is a book of good reading. If you want to take the time to read it. I haven't had much free time to read it, but now that you are getting supplies for me, I can take a break.

**You say:** `sack`



>**Clockwork VIIX says:** Before I provide the item, you must show me that you have spoken to Jeb.
