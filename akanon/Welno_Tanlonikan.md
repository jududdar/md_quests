**You say:** `tasks`




>**Welno Tanlonikan says:** Well I should hope you are truly a Rogue of Akanon or else I dont have any work for ya! However if you are then I have some things for you to do. I will present you with a magical box that you will use to craft together certain components that will make an armor material. You will then take the material that you have fashioned with the proper pattern to the forge to create your own armor. I will provide you with whatever patterns are necessary along with the armor [recipes] should you so ask.


**You say:** `recipes`




>**Welno Tanlonikan says:** I have the armor recipes for all pieces of Chainmail of the Shadowwalker all you must do is simply ask for whichever piece you want to craft. I can provide you with the recipe for Shadowwalker [Coifs], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Boots], [Leggings], [Gloves] and [Tunic]. Once you have collected the necessary components for each recipe combine them in this box to fashion the correct material.
