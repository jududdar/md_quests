## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Jovan says:** Not so loud! My head is spinning so! What I wouldn't give for a Tumpy's Tonic right now! They were always just the thing for the hair of the gnoll that bit me.

**You say:** `tumpy.* tonic`



>**Jovan says:** Ahh! If you need to ask, you've never had one. Tumpy Irontoe in Kaladim made me drink one of his special brews when I lost a game of King's Court with him. I would give anything I own for one of those right now!
