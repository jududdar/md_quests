# Marlin Shirtov
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Marlin Shirtov says:** What are you doing in here? I requested no room service. Now leave, quickly, before Mistress Anna comes!

**You say:** `mistress anna`



>**Marlin Shirtov says:** Mistress Anna is my lover. She will wed me as soon as she is through mourning the loss of her ex-lover. Until then, I shall continue to keep her well. She assures me she will be over it soon. I am sure she loves me. She meets with me often. 'At 9 in 6,' she always says.

**You say:** `princess lenya thex`



>**Marlin Shirtov says:** What was that about Princess Lenya? You know her? I feel sorry for her. I wish I had the courage to help her. I made the key for her special shackles. Maybe you can rescue her. Tell you what, I have always wanted to venture to Qeynos to buy a silk evening tunic for Mistress Anna. You go and get me it and I shall give you the key to Princess Lenya's shackles.
