# Barn Bloodstone


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Barn Bloodstone says:** You seem a little out of place here. You should go back to the nice little village you came from. This place will eat you alive. The [Golden Rooster] is no place for you.

**You say:** `blackburrow stout`



>**Barn Bloodstone says:** Blackburrow Stout is the finest drink available. It is the nectar of the gods. Well.. nectar of the gnolls at least. I can't wait until they hold another drink special in the Rooster. When I hear that. I am there!

**You say:** `golden rooster`



>**Barn Bloodstone says:** The Golden Rooster only happens to be the finest gambling house in Highpass. It is also the only place in these parts that serves [Blackburrow Stout].
