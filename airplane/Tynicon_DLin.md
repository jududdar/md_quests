## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Tynicon DLin says:** Great, let us waste no more time! I offer to you four challenges. Disempowement, Envenoming, Raising of the Dead, or Necropotence. Choose one to be tested on.

**You say:** `disempowerment`





>**Tynicon DLin says:** Disempowerment, destroying good magic. Proceed upward through the sky and return to me a Griffon Statuette, a Blood Sky Emerald, and Rusted Pauldrons. This will prove your abilities to me and I will reward you with Blood Sky Face plate.

**You say:** `envenoming`






>**Tynicon DLin says:** Venom and hate permeate us more than our dumber, larger brothers.  Return to me an efreeti war shield, a dark spiroc feather, and a shard of obsidian and prove that your soul is envenomed with hatred. If you do so, the obtenebrate mithril guard shall be yours.

**You say:** `raising of the dead`



>**Tynicon DLin says:** The dead are our allies against those that would oppose us. Proceed upward through the sky and return to me a Large Sky Pearl, a Jar of Honey, a Sphinxian Ring, and Fae Pauldrons. This will prove your abilities to me and I will reward you with an Pearlescent Pauldrons.

**You say:** `necropotence`





>**Tynicon DLin says:** Only the most powerful and vile of shadow knights manage to complete this test. Return to me an Efreeti War Axe, some Dulcet Nectar, a Bloodstained Hilt, and a Blood Sky Ruby. Doing so will earn you the right to wield the Drinker of Blood.
