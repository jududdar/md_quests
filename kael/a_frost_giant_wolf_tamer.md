>I didn't know Slime could speak common. Go back to the sewer before I lose my temper.

>Is that your BREATH, or did something die in here? Now go away!

>I wonder how much I could get for the tongue of a blithering fool? Leave before I decide to find out for myself.


**You say:** `looking for work`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then



>**a frost giant wolf tamer says:** Do you not see the wolves?  I train them.  I break them of their pride and make them into useful servants.  Only when they willingly accept the harness are they useful.

**You say:** `harness`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then



>**a frost giant wolf tamer says:** Aye.  Good metal.  We make their harnesses and wraps here in Kael from strong black steel.  You can't break a beast without a good strong harness.  I've learned that from years of working with them.

**You say:** `more work`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then



>**a frost giant wolf tamer says:** Yes. I was charged with a certain... delivery. Apparently one of our good friends named Erdarf in Thurgadin needs a shipment of one karsin acid bottle. You can find such a thing in Crystal Caverns. Maybe one of the orc dogs has it. Find a way to get one of those bottles to our good friend eh? When you do, let me see whatever it is you find on him.
