**You say:** `hail`



>**Zabaltin Draux says:** Enough with the chit chat. Are you or are you not a rogue?

**You say:** `rogue`



>**Zabaltin Draux says:** Good, I need you to serve Seru. There is a member of the Shoulder that is cutting the delivery of supplies to us and he must be stopped. He is a traitor to this city. He must be a sympathizer with the loyalists of Katta. What I need from you is poison. Go make me four vials of Aching Blood. We will see how he likes his wine with some of that in it!
