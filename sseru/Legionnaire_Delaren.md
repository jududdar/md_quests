# Legionnaire Delaren
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Legionnaire Delaren says:** Well met Soandso.  Are you the new recruit that was sent to me to help exterminate the [Zelniaks] that attack our guards and caravans?

**You say:** `zelniak`



>**Legionnaire Delaren says:** Weren't you briefed on this already?  The Zelianks are highly aggressive scaled creatures with a large mane of fur that runs down the length of their back.  They are a constant problem for the guards and caravans that used travel in [Dawnshroud].

**You say:** `dawnshroud`



>**Legionnaire Delaren says:** Are you new here or something?  Dawnshroud peaks are a range of mountains lush in vegetation and water.  We used to utilize this area as a trade route to Shadowhaven.  The caravans that would travel through were too often attacked by roaming Zelniaks.  I thought you were the one that was sent to me to [help lower] the amount of Zelniaks in the area.  So the trade route could be reestablished.

**You say:** `help lower`



>**Legionnaire Delaren says:** How ambitious of you to help the mighty warriors of the Hand.  If you chose to serve Seru bring me back four pieces of Zelniak meat.  I will reward you for your time in the field.

**You say:** `peran`



>**Legionnaire Delaren says:** Centurion Peran is new to the ranks.  He gets things done I suppose it just takes him a long, long time.  Since you did his job for him, take him these new orders.  We will make a soldier out of him yet.


**You receive:**  [Perans Orders](/item/6514)
