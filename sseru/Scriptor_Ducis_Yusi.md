# Scriptor Ducis Yusi
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** Greetings, Soandso.

**You say:** `where.* tavern`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** There are four taverns in Sanctus Seru.  The Red Eye, The Full Hand, The Unburdened Shoulders, and The Glad Heart.  One for the members of each Praesertum.

**You say:** `where.* shop`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** There are many fine shops in Sanctus Seru.  I suggest you browse them for yourselves.

**You say:** `where.* quest`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** Why surely, a city of this size will have many tasks for you to accomplish!  That is, once the builders get around to it.  Check back late in the summer or early in the fall, there should be much for you to do then.

**You say:** `where.* leader`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** Sanctus Seru is controlled by the four Praesertum, The Hand, The Eye, The Heart, and The Shoulders.  Each Praesertum has their own responsibilities.

**You say:** `leave`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** If you wish to leave the city, you must first pass by the Vigulum.  If they do not stop you, you are free to go.

**You say:** `lewt`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** Have you visited the Plane of Growth lately?

**You say:** `what.* question`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** The Question is what keeps us pure. Every two years, each citizen of Seru must submit to the Question. You can refuse the question, but then you are cast out of the city, one of The Recuso. Those that submit spend three days in the care of another Praesertum. If you are pure of thought and deed, you have nothing to worry about. If you are not pure, you can be cast out.

**You say:** `who.* seru`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** Seru is the genius behind the Combine Empire. A man of unfailing honor and honesty, he devised the Inquisition, to root out unclean elements in the Empire. His saddest day was when he discovered that Katta himself was a traitor. When confronted with proof of his treachery, Katta feigned his own murder, and fled to Luclin. Seru had no choice but to amass an expedition and follow after him.

**You say:** `who.* katta`



>*Scriptor Ducis Yusi spits on the ground. Katta, bah! Betrayer and destroyer of the Combine! I curse his name, curse his name, thrice curse his name!*

**You say:** `caravan`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** We run many caravans to and from Shadow Haven. As much as we dislike dealing with that unsavory lot, we find ourselves needing supplies only they can provide at the moment. Since they are not fond of coming out of their hole in the earth, we provide them with raw materials from the Lightside in return.

**You say:** `arena`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** We have a fine coliseum here in Sanctus Seru. Many glorious events are held there throughout the year, from plays to races, to gladiator games. It can be found at the far south of the city.

**You say:** `suck`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** I know you do, but what about us?

**You say:** `you.* suck`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** Verily, methInks YOU doth sucketh much more than I, Soandso.

**You say:** `mind`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** If you really must know, I am worried about my brother.

**You say:** `praesertum`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** The four Praesertum can be found in the center of the city. Each has their own building, easily identified by the symbol above the main entrance. Stay clear of the Arx Seru, the central building. This is the resting place of Seru, who does not allow anyone but the Praesertum to disturb him. To venture inside is death for all that are not invited.

**You say:** `what.* eye`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** The Eye keeps us informed of all that goes on beyond the walls. They are responsible for security and purity inside the walls as well. They also monitor the other three Praesertum.

**You say:** `what.* heart`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** The Heart is in charge of all things administrative. From collecting taxes to issuing swords, to making sure each citizen knows when it is time for the Question.

**You say:** `rogue guild`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** Um, er, I think you might want to visit either The Hand, The Eye, or The Shoulders. And stop looking at my purse.

**You say:** `druid guild`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** We have no primitives in our city. You might find them among the slovenly merchants in Fordel Midst. And I know there are some of them hiding in the foul Loyalist city.

**You say:** `necromancer guild`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** Do not speak to me of such foulness. It was evil of that nature that brought the Combine together in the first place. You will find nobody of that ilk here!


**You say:** `monk guild`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** Check with The Eye. Their Manstoppers are all of that profession.

**You say:** `shadowknight guild`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** Perversions such as that are not welcome here.

**You say:** `ranger guild`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** The Hand and The Eye both employ Rangers.  Check with them.

**You say:** `cleric guild`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** All four Praesertum have Clerics in their ranks.

**You say:** `magician guild`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** Well, lets see.  I know The Heart and The Shoulders have Magicians that work for them.  I would check there first.

**You say:** `enchanter guild`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** The Eye and The Heart have Enchanters.

**You say:** `wizard guild`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** All four Praesertum have Wizards in their employ, I'm sure you can find one that will be able to assist you.

**You say:** `warrior guild`



>**Scriptor Ducis Yusi says:** There is a warrior guildmaster in every Praesertum building.  Perhaps one would be willing to train you.
