# Centurion Rikola
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** Greetings, Soandso.

**You say:** `where.* tavern`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** There are four taverns in Sanctus Seru.  The Red Eye, The Full Hand, The Unburdened Shoulders, and The Glad Heart.  One for the members of each Praesertum.

**You say:** `where.* shop`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** There are many fine shops in Sanctus Seru.  I suggest you browse them for yourselves.

**You say:** `where.* quest`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** Why surely, a city of this size will have many tasks for you to accomplish!  That is, once the builders get around to it.  Check back late in the summer or early in the fall, there should be much for you to do then.

**You say:** `where.* leader`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** Sanctus Seru is controlled by the four Praesertum, The Hand, The Eye, The Heart, and The Shoulders.  Each Praesertum has their own responsibilities.

**You say:** `leave`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** If you wish to leave the city, you must first pass by the Vigulum.  If they do not stop you, you are free to go.

**You say:** `lewt`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** Have you visited the Plane of Growth lately?

**You say:** `what.* question`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** The Question is what keeps us pure. Every two years, each citizen of Seru must submit to the Question. You can refuse the question, but then you are cast out of the city, one of The Recuso. Those that submit spend three days in the care of another Praesertum. If you are pure of thought and deed, you have nothing to worry about. If you are not pure, you can be cast out.

**You say:** `who.* seru`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** Seru is the genius behind the Combine Empire. A man of unfailing honor and honesty, he devised the Inquisition, to root out unclean elements in the Empire. His saddest day was when he discovered that Katta himself was a traitor. When confronted with proof of his treachery, Katta feigned his own murder, and fled to Luclin. Seru had no choice but to amass an expedition and follow after him.

**You say:** `who.* katta`



>*Centurion Rikola spits on the ground. Katta, bah! Betrayer and destroyer of the Combine! I curse his name, curse his name, thrice curse his name!*

**You say:** `caravan`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** We run many caravans to and from Shadow Haven. As much as we dislike dealing with that unsavory lot, we find ourselves needing supplies only they can provide at the moment. Since they are not fond of coming out of their hole in the earth, we provide them with raw materials from the Lightside in return.

**You say:** `arena`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** We have a fine coliseum here in Sanctus Seru. Many glorious events are held there throughout the year, from plays to races, to gladiator games. It can be found at the far south of the city.

**You say:** `suck`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** I know you do, but what about us?

**You say:** `you.* suck`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** Verily, methInks YOU doth sucketh much more than I, Soandso.

**You say:** `mind`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** If you really must know, I am worried about my brother.

**You say:** `praesertum`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** The four Praesertum can be found in the center of the city. Each has their own building, easily identified by the symbol above the main entrance. Stay clear of the Arx Seru, the central building. This is the resting place of Seru, who does not allow anyone but the Praesertum to disturb him. To venture inside is death for all that are not invited.

**You say:** `what.* eye`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** The Eye keeps us informed of all that goes on beyond the walls. They are responsible for security and purity inside the walls as well. They also monitor the other three Praesertum.

**You say:** `what.* heart`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** The Heart is in charge of all things administrative. From collecting taxes to issuing swords, to making sure each citizen knows when it is time for the Question.

**You say:** `rogue guild`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** Um, er, I think you might want to visit either The Hand, The Eye, or The Shoulders. And stop looking at my purse.

**You say:** `druid guild`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** We have no primitives in our city. You might find them among the slovenly merchants in Fordel Midst. And I know there are some of them hiding in the foul Loyalist city.

**You say:** `necromancer guild`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** Do not speak to me of such foulness. It was evil of that nature that brought the Combine together in the first place. You will find nobody of that ilk here!


**You say:** `monk guild`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** Check with The Eye. Their Manstoppers are all of that profession.

**You say:** `shadowknight guild`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** Perversions such as that are not welcome here.

**You say:** `ranger guild`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** The Hand and The Eye both employ Rangers.  Check with them.

**You say:** `cleric guild`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** All four Praesertum have Clerics in their ranks.

**You say:** `magician guild`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** Well, lets see.  I know The Heart and The Shoulders have Magicians that work for them.  I would check there first.

**You say:** `enchanter guild`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** The Eye and The Heart have Enchanters.

**You say:** `wizard guild`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** All four Praesertum have Wizards in their employ, I'm sure you can find one that will be able to assist you.

**You say:** `warrior guild`



>**Centurion Rikola says:** There is a warrior guildmaster in every Praesertum building.  Perhaps one would be willing to train you.
