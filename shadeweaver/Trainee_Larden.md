## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Trainee Larden says:** I agree with Karim. I went on a scouting mission into the gor taku caves, they were definitely building fortifications. They have a slew of builders constructing defences from the stones collected by the workers. We have to strike them before they have finished their preperations for battle.
