# Shekar


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Shekar says:** I suppose you are here to ask me how to create a Claw Beast Talon Club? Yes, yes, I thought you might be. So many young ones looking for these, my poor claws are sore from all the assembly. Of course, I will make one for you, so long as you return to me with the correct [items].

**You say:** `items`



>**Shekar says:** To assemble this club, I require only two things. The first is a wooden practice flail. The second is a talon from the great claw beasts. They are quite rare, and large, and might be a difficult kill.
end
