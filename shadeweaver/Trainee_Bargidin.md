## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Trainee Bargidin says:** Alas, I have little will to talk right now. It is a [sad time].

**You say:** `sad time`



>**Trainee Bargidin says:** My good friend Torin ventured into the thicket alone a few days ago. There's been no sign of him since. I fear the [saurek deathmaws] have done him in.

**You say:** `deathmaw`



>**Trainee Bargidin says:** The deathmaws would be the only creature in the thicket that could possibly kill Torin. He could handle just about any other hopper, but few can survive a deathmaw attack. Reward or no, I vow I will someday slay those beasts... I'll kill them if it's the last thing I do.
