**You say:** `horrible thing`



>**Trainee Amikar says:** While I was gathering hopper pelts from the thickets, I spotted a shak dratha seeker perform a strange ritual over a wounded Loda Kai brigand. I could have sworn I saw his very soul ripped from his own body as he lay there wounded. The Loda Kai may be our enemies, but some evil actions are beyond others.
