**You say:** `poachers`



>**Sentry Ferin says:** Some of the Loda Kai heathens have seen fit to trade in the pelts of our felidae cousins. It disgusts me to think what they are doing with the hides of the proud cats of this land. Were there only adventurers brave enough to [champion their cause]...

**You say:** `champion their cause`



>**Sentry Ferin says:** Fighting for the honor of our cause is no small undertaking. Go and hunt down this cowardly lot. Take back from them what they have stolen and fill this casket so that the fallen cats might be honored properly.
