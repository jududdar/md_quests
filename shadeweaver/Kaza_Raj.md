# Kaza Raj




## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Kaza Raj says:** Ah. greetings!  I am Kaza Raj, trainer of young Vah'shir!  Bring me the items I ask and I will reward you with pieces of armor to protect you in your travels.  I have a fine pair of [gloves] available now if you're interested.

**You say:** `glove`



>**Kaza Raj says:** Great!  Let's start with the gloves then, shall we?  Gloves, yes indeed - I will give them to you if you go out and kill Cht'Thk Bloodlings.  Bring me four Sharp Bloodling Mandibles as proof of your deeds.

**You say:** `bracer`



>**Kaza Raj says:** Ah yes, a  Bracer. I'm sure I have one here somewhere.  I'll look for it while you do me a service.  Skeletal Brigands and Hunters have been endangering our young ones, seek them out and bring me four Broken Skulls!

**You say:** `boots`



>**Kaza Raj says:** You are doing fine work. I'm so pleased to have met you!  I'm confident you can help me again if you're interested.  The guards have mentioned a problem with Shades roaming too near the city.  I'd like to see if we can do something about that. Go and kill Lesser Shades, and bring me four Shadowed Claws and I will give you some boots as a reward!

**You say:** `sleeves`



>**Kaza Raj says:** Have you seen the Loda Kai in your explorations?  They are a great menace, oh very bad indeed!  They're nothing but criminals and brigands, ooooh how I hate them.. Fetch me four Loda Kai earrings and I shall give you some fine sleeves for your trouble!

**You say:** `cap`



>**Kaza Raj says:** Excellent work dispatching those Brigands! Now seek out Loda Kai thugs and return with four Insignia, I shall give you a useful cap if you serve me well!

**You say:** `tunic`



>**Kaza Raj says:** A breastplate shall complete your set! Bring me four carapaces from Cht'Thk Bloodbulks and I will give you a wonderful tunic!

**You say:** `pant`



>**Kaza Raj says:** Hmm, you are growing more mighty as time passes - Kill Saurek Claw Beasts and bring me four fangs, I have most excellent pants if you succeed.
