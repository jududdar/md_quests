## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Trainee Naria says:** Have you noticed the vicious Saurek [Shredders] out in the thicket? I wouldn't want to hunt one of those nasty things.

**You say:** `shredder`



>**Trainee Naria says:** The shredder has been known tear young hunters apart in mere seconds. I would stay far away from those things if I were you. Tarief has offered a reward for any that bring him four of their scales, but I just don't think it would be worth facing such a beast in battle. The meat from the smaller ones are just as good to eat if you want my opinion.
