## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Captain Alim says:** Have you come for training young one?  The way of the Beastlord teaches many things about the forces of nature.  The [forces] in the thicket are very interesting.

**You say:** `forces`



>**Captain Alim says:** Yes, the force that compels a creature to adjust to their surroundings in particular.  The Saurek have seem to adapted to their environment very well.  I am studying the effects of their claws.   It seems the different [variety] of Saurek have special enhancements.

**You say:** `variety`



>**Captain Alim says:** Well, for example the Firefall Saurek can attack with claws that burn the flesh, the Deathmaw attack with poisonous claws. The shredder Saurek are especially skilled in fending off the Tegi that threaten them, and lastly there is a more uncommon Claw Beast that is very strong but does not appear that often.  I believe I could take their claws and affix them to a weapon to [enhance] it.

**You say:** `enhance`



>**Captain Alim says:** If you would like to test this theory, speak with my trainees, located behind me. I have taught them everything I know about making these clubs. Each trainee specializes in creating a different club, based upon the components they require. Return to them with the correct components, and they will attempt to fashion the claws to the flail.
