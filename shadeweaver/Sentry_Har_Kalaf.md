# Sentry Har Kalaf


## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Sentry Har Kalaf says:** Tread cautiously here. The road to the [paludal] caverns is a dangerous journey these days.

**You say:** `what paludal?`



>**Sentry Har Kalaf says:** The paludal caverns lie to the north, just beyond that copse of blue payala trees. Be careful if you decide to head that way, there are many [dangers] on the road to the north.

**You say:** `what dangers?`



>**Sentry Har Kalaf says:** The spirits have been restless in the northern region. The shak dratha have also been attacking travelers and merchants alike. I hear there is some good hunting within the Paludal caverns, however. The journey may be worth your while.
