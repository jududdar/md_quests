## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Trainee Jonkar says:** Well met Soandso. Pay close attention to Captain Tarief's words of advice. It takes a skillful hunter to kill a Saurek [Darkclaw]. His advice could mean the difference between life and death.

**You say:** `darkclaw`



>**Trainee Jonkar says:** The darkclaws are nasty beasts. Their claws are much thicker than the smaller saureks. Tarief has offered a reward to any that return with four of their scales to him. Don't get any ideas now. That reward is mine. I assure you.
