## Dialog 

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Fiddy Bobick says:** Ahoy, mate!! The name's Fiddy Bobick! Perhaps you've heard of me.. the greatest halfling to sail the seas of Norrath? I have been to the North, South, East and West, and thank Prexus. I have survived it all!  Why I have returned to this little hollow is a wonder to me. Obviously, the salty air finally got to my brain!

**You say:** `sent me`



>**Fiddy Bobick says:** Well, it's about blasted time!  The ship was about to sink.  Wickystick finally managed to send the troops in!  The problem, mate, is piranha !!  What?!!  That's what I said.  Piranha!  The lake is infested with the little buggers.  More and more every sunrise.  They're chomping down all our food supply.  You have gotta get your can in the drink and kill them.  Take one of their teeth to old Wickystick and see what she has to say about Fiddy then!  I will also give you some booty for any teeth you pull out of this river.  Well, get going, Deputy Soandso!
