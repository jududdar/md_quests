# Kizzie Mintopp








## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Kizzie Mintopp says:** Enough talk there, chatterbox.  You buy lots of herbs.  I gotta make a living, not more friends.

**You say:** `temple of life`



>**Kizzie Mintopp says:** Oh, yes.. They always come for Kizzie's [honey jum]. They should have sent you next week. There is a [problem].

**You say:** `problem`



>**Kizzie Mintopp says:** You see.. Joogl Honeybugger is hurt. He usually collects the [Honeycombs]. Only he knows where to get them. I need the Honeycombs to make the Honey Jum. Go and speak with Joogl. He is at his burrow outside of Rivervale. He says he cannot work. Tell him you need the Honeycombs.

**You say:** `honeycombs`



>**Kizzie Mintopp says:** If Kizzie knew that, then she would not hire Joogl Honeybugger!  Go talk to him in the Misty Thicket.

**You say:** `make`



>**Kizzie Mintopp says:** No, no, no!!  You will not get honey jum until you give Kizzie three honeycombs and thirty gold coins.  Honey jum is valuable.  Kizzie raised the fee!!  That is how it works.

**You say:** `honey jum`



>**Kizzie Mintopp says:** It's a secret!!  I get the honeycombs and combine them with the secret sauce and..presto.. honey jum!!  It is used by only the wisest as a component.  And you can only get it from Kizzie.  It is also good on batwing crunchies.  If you like.. Kizzie can [make honey jum] for you?
