**You say:** `hail`




>**Lendel Deeppockets says:** It's nice to meet you Soandso. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Lendel Deeppockets master Assassin of Rivervale. I am personally in charge of all [training] we have the new recruits go through before they are sent out on specific missions.


**You say:** `stanos`




>**Lendel Deeppockets says:** Stanos is an old... <cough>... buddy of mine.  If yer looking for work, ya could take a message from me to him.  Just tell him I sent ya, and see what he wants.  But I gotta warn ya, he has more than a few fellers what want him dead, and anyone around him, too.  Other side of the coin, he pays well and is fair, and looks after his own.  Yer choice, you want the job or not?


**You say:** `want.* job`




>**Lendel Deeppockets says:** You're a spunky one, eh, " .. e.other:Race() .. "!  Ok, first off, you gots to find him.  Just tell him I sent you to help, and he should take it from there.  Ya might want to check the Karanas, I think he's been spotted around there lately.


**You say:** `training`




>**Lendel Deeppockets says:** There are many steps that a young rouge must take on the road to stealth. The most important part of your training is learning how to use the tools around you such as the forge. From the looks of you I can tell you could use some more [enchanted armor] as well so I think this would be a good learning experience.


**You say:** `enchanted armor`




>**Lendel Deeppockets says:** I am pleased to hear that you are interested in making your own armor Soandso. I have some instructions for you so please listen closely. First, I will present you with your Dusty Mail Assembly kit when you are ready. After that, simply tell me what piece of Slickfinger Chainmail you [want] to craft and I will give you a pattern along with a recipe for  [Coifs], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Boots], [Legplates], [Gauntlets] and [Tunics]. The recipe I will give you for specific items will need to me combined in the assembly kit to create the magical material necessary. Once you have this material and pattern that I gave you when you told me what item you wanted to craft, put both in the nearest forge to create the armor piece you asked for. Here is your Dusty Mail Assembly Kit.



**You receive:**  [Dusty Mail Assembly Kit](/item/17247)


**You say:** `coifs`




>**Lendel Deeppockets says:** Protecting the ole noggin is probably the smartest move you will make young Soandso. Here is your pattern, once you have combined 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Ruined Thorn Drakeling Scales and 1 Carrot in your kit place it in a forge along with this pattern to create your Slickfinger Chainmail Coif.



**You receive:**  [An Enchanted Coif Pattern](/item/22671)


**You say:** `bracers`




>**Lendel Deeppockets says:** Go out into the thicket and seek out 1 Brick of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Shattered Warbead, 1 Large Yellowjacket Sternite and 1 Milk. Once you have combined them in your kit to fashion the bracer material take it to a forge along with this pattern to create your Slickfinger Chainmail Bracer.



**You receive:**  [An Enchanted Bracer Pattern](/item/22672)


**You say:** `sleeves`




>**Lendel Deeppockets says:** If sleeves are what you wish to craft you will need to collect 3 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 3 Honeycombs, 2 Thorn Drakeling Scales and 2 Grapes then combine them in your kit to fashion the necessary material. Take this pattern to the nearest forge with that material to create your Sleeves of the Slickfinger.



**You receive:**  [An Enchanted Sleeves Pattern](/item/22673)


**You say:** `boots`




>**Lendel Deeppockets says:** Boots you say Soandso? Well I think I heard you right but I had to check. Make sure you only wear your boots in case of emergency. All other times you should showcase your feet to the world with pride. You will need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Fire Beetle Eyes and 2 Giant Thicket Rat Skulls in your kit to fashion your Slickfinger Boot Material. Once you have done this take the material to a forge along with this pattern to create your Slickfinger Chainmail Boots.



**You receive:**  [An Enchanted Boots Pattern](/item/22674)


**You say:** `legplates`




>**Lendel Deeppockets says:** I must say that pants are a good idea young Soandso. Please gather 4 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Spiderling Eyes, 2 Large Wood Spider Tarsus, 1 Bottle of Kalish and 1 Ruined Wolf Pelt then combine them in your kit to create your Legplates Material.



**You receive:**  [An Enchanted Legplates Pattern](/item/22675)


**You say:** `gauntlets`




>**Lendel Deeppockets says:** Your gauntlets may possibly be the most important part of armor. One should always be sure that their hands are not exposed, because taking a blow to the hand is a lot worse then getting hurt anywhere else! To create the gauntlet material please collect 3 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Bixie Wings, 1 Large Snake Skin and 1 Red Wine.



**You receive:**  [An Enchanted Gauntlets Pattern](/item/22676)


**You say:** `tunic`




>**Lendel Deeppockets says:** I'm happy to see that your training is coming along so well Soandso. I have no doubt in my mind that you are ready to craft your tunic. Please collect 5 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Giant Wood Spider Femurs, 1 Embalming Dusts, 1 Dark Elf Skin and 1 Giant Yellowjacket Thorax. Come back after you are finished. I have a [job] for you.



**You receive:**  [An Enchanted Tunic Pattern](/item/22677)


**You say:** `job`




>**Lendel Deeppockets says:** Orcs is the job Soandso. Plain and simple I cannot stand these homewreckers. They have moved into our land and continue to storm our front gate. I seek out bone fragments and fractured jawbones from these nasty Orcs. Once we have 1 of each we will be able to create a weapon for you to use.

## Signals

>**Lendel Deeppockets says:** Find somebody to go see what he wants. I don't like the idea of making Hanns mad at us, but I also don't like the idea of looking over my shoulder for Stanos. He is not somebody I would care to dance with, and I DO owe him.
