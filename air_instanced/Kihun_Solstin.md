# Kihun Solstin
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Kihun Solstin says:** So, you have made it this far. I am Kihun Solstin, the Master of Wind. I control the unfettered Element like none other. As you should have learned, Air is the most potent of Elements. It fuels Fire, Water is comprised of it, and Earth cannot restrain it. Knowing this, do you seek the Element of Wind?

**You say:** `element of wind`



>**Kihun Solstin says:** I will test you then. In this wondrous plane of Sky, find the Crown of Elemental Mastery. Then, search the world below for an Elemental Binder and a cloak fashioned from the feathers of a Pegusus. Return them to me and I shall give you the Element of Wind.

**You say:** `see the master`
