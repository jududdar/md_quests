# Gregori Lightbringer
## On NPC Spawn

**Set a timer** named *depop* for 300 seconds
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Gregori Lightbringer says:** Hail and well met! You have traveled far indeed to cross my path. I will be testing you in compassion, sacrifice, and love. Are you ready for the test of the heart, Soandso?

**You say:** `test of the heart`



>**Gregori Lightbringer says:** As I said before, the test of the heart is in three parts.  Compassion, Sacrifice and Love. Choose one and we will begin.

**You say:** `compassion`




>**Gregori Lightbringer says:** Compassion is of great importance to us. Without it, we do not feel empathy, and cannot truly follow the path we claim to travel. Return to me an Efreeti zweihander, dulcet nectar, a golden hilt, and a large sky diamond. If you present these to me, I will award you Truvinan, the divine wind.

**You say:** `sacrifice`




>**Gregori Lightbringer says:** You have sacrificed much to come so far, Erudite.  Sacrifice this one last time and the Sword of the Ocean shall be yours.  Retrieve a griffon statuette, a spiroc peace totem, and a bixie sword blade.

**You say:** `love`





>**Gregori Lightbringer says:** Love is what brings us close to the gods we follow.  Without it, we could not truly worship them, and would be lost.  Prove yourself to me and return with a dark spiroc feather, ethereal topaz, and a sphinxian claw.  In return, I will give you Thelvorn.
