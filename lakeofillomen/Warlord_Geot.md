# Warlord Geot
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Warlord Geot says:** Greetings!! You look like an adventurer. I have a bit of a problem with which you might be able to help. You see, there have been reports of sarnak hatchlings near the lake. I do not know why they are here, but I do know we need them exterminated. Here is the deal.. You bash them good and return their brains to me. For every four brains, I shall reward you.

**You say:** `trooper reporting for duty`



>**Warlord Geot says:** Very good to have you on board, Trooper Soandso! We have had reports of sarnak legionnaires attacking caravans. I shall require you to find these sarnak legionnaires. Take this pack. Fill and combine it with as many of their brains as sill fit inside. Return the full pack to me and I shall consider you for a promotion.


**You receive:**  [Lake Garrison Pack](/item/17044)
