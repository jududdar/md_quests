>**Relik says:** Ah, good. That's what I wanted to hear. We be needin' help with supplies. I been needin' pickheads for a while now but the minin' guild hasn't had the stock ta send 'em. We're gonna need ta improvise. I've seen the gashes left in rock after a shardwurm crawled over it and I think that be the thing we need. If ya can bring me four shardwurm claws, maybe I can rig 'em up into enough picks to keep us runnin' on time with our crystal mining.
