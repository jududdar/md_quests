# gnomish deserter


## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>*gnomish deserter smiles at you and nods congenially.  'Hullo there.  Nice ta meet ya.' He moves to shake your hand and then seems to remember that his hand is currently frozen to a very heavy, very solid hunk of metal shaped somewhat like a box.*

**You say:** `box`



>**gnomish deserter says:** Huh?  Box?  Where's a box?  Heh.  I don't see a box.

**You say:** `stuck`



>**gnomish deserter says:** Erm.  Well ya see.  One day I was on guard duty and a huge white cat knocked me over.  It looked like it was running away towards the bridge island.  Anyways, I fell into the water.  I guess I passed out because next thing I knew I was over near the gnolls laying on top of this huge box.  It's then that I made the decision.

**You say:** `decision`



>**gnomish deserter says:** To leave.  I'm really tired of this pirate stuff.  Captain Nalot said it was gonna be great fun and an adventure but all I've seen is a lot of biscuits, slush water, and guard duty.  So I'm here.

**You say:** `here`



>**gnomish deserter says:** Yup.  This isn't such a bad spot.  It's nice and peaceful.  I can see for miles and every once in a while someone like you drops by to talk.  There's no guard duty and I don't have to say 'Arrrr' anymore.  That really starts to hurt your throat, you know.  The only problem I have anymore is my hand frozen to this box.  If ya find a way to fix it let me know.

>*gnomish deserter grins and pours the ooze on his hand and the box.  You hear a burning sizzle and then the box thumps onto the ground.  'Ow! Ow! Take it!  Hah.  I never thought I'd get rid of that piece of...'*
