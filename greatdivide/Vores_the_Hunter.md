## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>*Vores the Hunter squints and looks in your direction. 'Who is that? I can't see ya but yer not Coldain and yer voice is too whiny for a giant. We ain't bashin' each other's brains in yet so ya can't be all that bad. Come have a seat by me fire. But quiet yerself down already. The wurms may not be the best at sniffin out people but best not to test em'.*

**You say:** `wurm`



>**Vores the Hunter says:** Ye must be kidding me, outlander. Sure'n ya got eyes. The shardwurms. If ye can't see em then ya best not be tryin' ta put on yer pants for fear of stabbin' yerself with a sword.

**You say:** `control`



>**Vores the Hunter says:** Control. Aye. Break em like dogs or such. Domesticate em. I ain't ever found a way, all I got is me theories.

**You say:** `theories`



>**Vores the Hunter says:** It ain't so complex like a caster's diagrams 'n such. I just be thinkin' mebbe ya need a somethin' like a leash and then maybe some magical gem o' control. Uh, maybe. Ain't much for years o' work, eh? Unfortunately, I tried a hundread of other things already. Them wurms chafe at any attempt at control.
