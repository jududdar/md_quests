>*Argan Milek sobs, 'I am so relieved to hear those words!  Please help me to escape this place.  She has taken my sight and replaced it with loathsome visions of some distant prison.  The Foul Mistress mocks the only thing I once felt a kinship to, my art.  I cannot scrub these visions from my eyes.  I fear that I will never be able to paint again.  Can you save what is left of my memories?  I can you restore my sight?'*
