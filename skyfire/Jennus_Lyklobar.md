# Jennus Lyklobar
## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**Jennus Lyklobar says:** Hello and well met! A " .. e.other:Race() .. " like you does not often come here.. Do you come seeking what I possess? Fire, fire, fire and fire is mine! I surround myself with fire, I bathe in fire, I consume fire, I am the Master of Fire! Hahahaha, but I digress. Have you come for the element of Fire, seeking to fall to the same fate as Trilith Magi'kot?

**You say:** `i have come for the element of fire`



>**Jennus Lyklobar says:** The Element of Fire I can provide you, but you must prove you are able to contain its power. Bring me the Torch of the Elements now kept by a doomed lord of merchants, the burning embers from a notable member of wurmkind who can be found a short journey from here and a blazing wand, which you should be familiar with. And you must surrender the tome Rykas gave you. But I think you would be happier if you stayed with me and learned more of the beauty of the one true element, FIRE! FIRE! Hahahahahahah!
