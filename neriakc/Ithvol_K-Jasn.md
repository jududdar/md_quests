# Ithvol K-Jasn





## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then



>**Ithvol K-Jasn says:** Hail, Soandso! I sense the gift of hatred in your aura. What status do you hold within these Spires?


elseif **Faction** >= Indifferent then



>**Ithvol K-Jasn says:** Although I sense the hate building within you, you have not yet done enough service to this temple to be trusted!


else



>**Ithvol K-Jasn says:** You are worthless and pathetic! You could never be of service to our temple!  Begone before your innards decorate our walls!




**You say:** `initiate`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then



>**Ithvol K-Jasn says:** Well met, Initiate Soandso. If you desire to raise your station in this temple, I have a task for you. Are you willing to accept the task I am about to set before you?


elseif **Faction** >= Indifferent then



>**Ithvol K-Jasn says:** Although I sense the hate building within you, you have not yet done enough service to this temple to be trusted!


else



>**Ithvol K-Jasn says:** You are worthless and pathetic! You could never be of service to our temple!  Begone before your innards decorate our walls!




**You say:** `willing`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then



>**Ithvol K-Jasn says:** As an initiate of the Spires, you have proven your hatred of the halflings who are desecrating our forest with their feeble shrines and camps. They persist in their hopeless task and seem to anticipate many of our tactics against them. Go out into the Nektulos and slay the one called Master Whoopal. Take his head to Draxiz N'Ryt so that he may probe the brain.

**You say:** `disciple`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then



>**Ithvol K-Jasn says:** I have an important task for a disciple of Hate such as yourself. It is no secret that King Naythox Thex wishes to expand the Teir'Dal Empire to the continent of Faydwer. We have a camp established in the Lesser Faydark near the stronghold of the vampire lord, Mayong Mistmoore. The camp is constantly under siege by the Fier'Dal and Koada'Dal and must rely on the support of Neriak for supplies necessary to survival. Are you willing to serve your King and Empire by delivering the provisions?

**You say:** `deliver the provisions`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then



>**Ithvol K-Jasn says:** The provisions are crated and prepared for shipment by Dran Slug Rembor. Go to his establishment in the Foreign Quarter and tell him Ithvol sent you. Make haste, young disciple of Hate! The fate of the Empire hangs upon our support of the Faydark Camp!


elseif **Faction** >= Indifferent then
