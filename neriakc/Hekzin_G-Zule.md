# Hekzin G-Zule
## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Hekzin G-Zule says:** How's it going, scrub? Correct me if I'm wrong, but you appear to be a rogue. If you're a [new rogue], it's my job to test your skill.  If you are not, then by speaking with me, I see you show interest in [joining this house of rogues].

**You say:** `new rogue`



if **Faction** >= Amiable then 



>**Hekzin G-Zule says:** We of the Ebon Mask must first be sure you are skilled with a blade. At the same time, we are attempting to create a new type of armor for our rogues. So it is the test of each young rogue to take this bag into Nektulos and fill it with three moss snake skins and three snake fangs, then combine them. We get the bag and you earn a little respect as well as the [Dark Shield of Ebon].



**You receive:**  [Empty Bag](/item/17943)



>**Hekzin G-Zule says:** You have done nothing to upset the Ebon Mask, but there is much more which you must do before we do business.  Perhaps a task from Master Hekzin shall set things right.

>**Hekzin G-Zule says:** You are quite bold to approach a member of the Ebon Mask. Now be smart and run away.




**You say:** `what dark shield of ebon`



>**Hekzin G-Zule says:** The Dark Shield of Ebon was made for the use of this house by the finest craftsmen of Neriak.  It can be carried in the hand as well as slung upon one's back.  Besides this advantage, it is much lighter than most other shields.
