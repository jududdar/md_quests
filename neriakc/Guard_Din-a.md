# Guard Din-a


## Dialog

**You say:** `supplies`



>**Guard Din-a says:** The local guild houses should sell a few items, but the best place to visit would be the Commons Quarter.  It is filled with shops.

**You say:** `wizard guild`



>**Guard Din-a says:** The three circles of arcane science known as magic, enchantment and wizardry are studied in the Commons Quarter by the Spurned at the Tower of the Spurned.

**You say:** `weapons`



>**Guard Din-a says:** You might want to venture over to the Commons Quarter.  They have quite a few forges as well as the weapons sold at the Cauldron of Hate.

**You say:** `bank`



>**Guard Din-a says:** Go to the Commons Quarter and you shall find a place called Neriak Down Under.  Within this tunnel you shall find the Burnished Coin.

**You say:** `inn`



>**Guard Din-a says:** This is no place for outsiders.  That is why the Smuggler's Inn is located in the Foreign Quarter.

**You say:** `forge`



>**Guard Din-a says:** Look in the Commons Quarter for a public forge.

**You say:** `warrior guild`



>**Guard Din-a says:** The Cauldron of Hate in the Commons Quarter houses the masters of the Teir'Dal warriors, the Indigo Brotherhood.

**You say:** `indigo brotherhood`



>**Guard Din-a says:** In the Commons Quarter can be found the Indigo Brotherhood, Teir'Dal warriors.  They are the armies of King Naythox Thex and serve as the trainers of the Dreadguard and dragoons.  Why the masters chose to build the Cauldron of Hate in that area and not the Third Gate is an amazement to me.

**You say:** `king`



>**Guard Din-a says:** The empire of the Teir'Dal is controlled by King Naythox Thex.  Some say Queen Cristanos is a much more fitting ruler.

**You say:** `queen`



>**Guard Din-a says:** Queen Cristanos is the queen of Neriak, of course!  She was the one who formed the necromancers and shadowknights into the guild called the Dead.

**You say:** `rogue guild`



>**Guard Din-a says:** Within this quarter is the Hall of the Ebon Mask.  The Ebon Mask are Neriak's rogues.

**You say:** `healer`



>**Guard Din-a says:** How can you be allowed in Neriak's Third Gate and not know of the Priests of Innoruuk?  Theirs is the first temple you see when entering the Third Gate.

**You say:** `the dead`



>**Guard Din-a says:** The Dead are the shadowknights and necromancers of Neriak.  They were formed by Queen Cristanos herself.  Even among the Teir'Dal they are feared and they keep to themselves within the Lodge of the Dead in the Third Gate.  I have heard they take orders only from the queen.

**You say:** `kiln`



>**Guard Din-a says:** You will find none of that here.  The public oven, kiln, pottery wheel and brew barrel are all within the Foreign Quarter.

**You say:** `bard guild`



>**Guard Din-a says:** A class of people lost in their mythical art.  They are nothing more than dust under the feet of the empire of the Teir'Dal.

**You say:** `paladin guild`



>**Guard Din-a says:** Hold your tongue, whelp!  You are on the grounds of the shadowknights.  If they were to hear you talking of such things they would skin you alive!

**You say:** `loom`



>**Guard Din-a says:** A sewing kit may be purchased at the Furrier Royale in Neriaks Third Quarter or at the Silk Underground in Neriaks Foreign Quarter. A community loom may be found at the Silk Underground in Neriaks Foreign Quarter.
