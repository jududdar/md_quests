## Dialog

**You say:** `Hail`



>**Pazin Punox says:** Welcome to the Hall of the Ebon Mask. You had best be a rogue or you have no business here. We have nothing to say to outsiders.

**You say:** `dark assassin`



>**Pazin Punox says:** Aye we were visited by that dark assassin, he left some sketch in my safekeeping, I would gladly give you a copy if you would take care of a problem that has been vexing me.

**You say:** `vexing you`



>**Pazin Punox says:** An old student of mine who goes by the name Lon has disgraced this House; his betrayal to Innoruuk and Neriak is unforgivable.' Pazin grins 'He must be punished through deceit and trickery. Make him your friend, do as he asks, and pretend to be Redeemed as he calls it. Once you are Redeemed take the cursed blade of Ro and run it through his heart. Bring me his rapier and his head and I shall know the task is complete.
