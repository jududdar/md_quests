## Dialog

**You say:** `supplies`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** The local guild houses should sell a few items, but the best place to visit would be the Commons Quarter.  It is filled with shops.

**You say:** `wizard guild`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** The three circles of arcane science known as magic, enchantment and wizardry are studied in the Commons Quarter by the Spurned at the Tower of the Spurned.

**You say:** `weapons`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** You might want to venture over to the Commons Quarter.  They have quite a few forges as well as the weapons sold at the Cauldron of Hate.

**You say:** `bank`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** Go to the Commons Quarter and you shall find a place called Neriak Down Under.  Within this tunnel you shall find the Burnished Coin.

**You say:** `inn`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** This is no place for outsiders.  That is why the Smuggler's Inn is located in the Foreign Quarter.

**You say:** `forge`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** Look in the Commons Quarter for a public forge.

**You say:** `warrior guild`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** The Cauldron of Hate in the Commons Quarter houses the masters of the Teir'Dal warriors, the Indigo Brotherhood.

**You say:** `indigo brotherhood`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** In the Commons Quarter can be found the Indigo Brotherhood, Teir'Dal warriors.  They are the armies of King Naythox Thex and serve as the trainers of the Dreadguard and dragoons.  Why the masters chose to build the Cauldron of Hate in that area and not the Third Gate is an amazement to me.

**You say:** `king`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** The empire of the Teir'Dal is controlled by King Naythox Thex.  Some say Queen Cristanos is a much more fitting ruler.

**You say:** `queen`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** Queen Cristanos is the queen of Neriak, of course!  She was the one who formed the necromancers and shadowknights into the guild called the Dead.

**You say:** `rogue guild`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** Within this quarter is the Hall of the Ebon Mask.  The Ebon Mask are Neriak's rogues.

**You say:** `healer`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** How can you be allowed in Neriak's Third Gate and not know of the Priests of Innoruuk?  Theirs is the first temple you see when entering the Third Gate.

**You say:** `the dead`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** The Dead are the shadowknights and necromancers of Neriak.  They were formed by Queen Cristanos herself.  Even among the Teir'Dal they are feared and they keep to themselves within the Lodge of the Dead in the Third Gate.  I have heard they take orders only from the queen.

**You say:** `kiln`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** You will find none of that here.  The public oven, kiln, pottery wheel and brew barrel are all within the Foreign Quarter.

**You say:** `bard guild`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** A class of people lost in their mythical art.  They are nothing more than dust under the feet of the empire of the Teir'Dal.

**You say:** `paladin guild`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** Hold your tongue, whelp!  You are on the grounds of the shadowknights.  If they were to hear you talking of such things they would skin you alive!

**You say:** `loom`



>**Guard V-Lask says:** A sewing kit may be purchased at the Furrier Royale in Neriaks Third Quarter or at the Silk Underground in Neriaks Foreign Quarter. A community loom may be found at the Silk Underground in Neriaks Foreign Quarter.
