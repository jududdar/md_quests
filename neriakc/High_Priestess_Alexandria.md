## Dialog

**You say:** `hail`



>**High Priestess Alexandria says:** Greetings child, what business do you have here? I'm sorry but I will only deal with Clerics that are willing to prove their loyalty to Innoruuk. I cannot deal with every single heathen that feels it is necessary to bid me a good day. If you are a [Cleric of Innoruuk] I might be able to aid you in your training.

elseif(e.other:GetClass() == 2 and e.other:GetRace() == 6 and eq.get_current_expansion() >= 4.0) then


**You say:** `cleric of innoruuk`




>**High Priestess Alexandria says:** Is that so " .. e.other:Race() .. " Soandso. Well from the looks of you I wouldn't say you are much of anything yet. However, if you have the willingness and determination to serve your God then there might just be more hope for you then I would have thought. Obviously, to move forward in your training, you will need to shield yourself from your enemies and from the elements. I believe I have something that could help you if you are still [interested in proving yourself]


**You say:** `interested in proving myself`




>**High Priestess Alexandria says:** Well I must say that I am impressed by your eagerness to learn, however, you are not the first and will not be the last I am sure that has sworn devotion to our Lord Innoruuk. Lets just hope you don'tup in the burial grounds where many promising young ones before you have found their resting place. If you are ready to begin gathering items to fashion your very own Initiate Darkpriest Armor then I will present you with a [magical relic].


**You say:** `magical relic`




>**High Priestess Alexandria says:** I have a box that I have been keeping for quite some time and have been waiting to present it to someone like yourself. Someone that I had faith would be strong enough to use it's power to their benefit. This magical box can be used to refine certain metals into a magical compound that is used in crafting Initiate Darkpriest armor pieces. I have the molds necessary to craft Initiate Darkpriest [Helms], [Bracers], [Boots], [Armguards], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. However there are some [important items] that you will need to collect before the molds will be of any use to you. One thing to keep in mind is that I suggest you craft your Breastplate last due to the difficulty of obtaining the items needed for that specific recipe.

**You say:** `important item`




>**High Priestess Alexandria says:** There are certain items that will need to be gathered in our great city of Neriak along with many different things gathered outside in the Forest of Nektulos, where most of your training will take place. The most important component that you will need to collect while adventuring in the forest are Helms that are only worn by Priests of Rodcet Nife. These vile creatures have set up camp in the forest from what I have heard and it is your responsibility to find and execute them. These helms will be your most important component that you will gather because it is used in all [armor recipes] as the metal that you will forge your armor with.


**You say:** `armor recipe`




>**High Priestess Alexandria says:** Ah of course, I almost forgot that you will need to know what items to combine in the Dark Blessed Box that I presented you with. Simply tell me the armor piece that you wish to craft and I will give you the list of items that you will need to combine, along with the applicable mold. For example, should you want to craft a Helm first you would say, I want to craft a Initiate Darkpriest\`s Helm. Please remember that the exact items must be combined in exact quantities in the box or the infusion will not take place. After you have combined together the items necessary to infuse your metal the correct way, you will need to take the Refined sheet of Holy Metal to the nearest forge and combine it with the correct mold to yield your armor piece.


**You say:** `armguard`

**You say:** `helm`




>**High Priestess Alexandria says:** A Helm you say Soandso?

**You say:** `final test`




>**High Priestess Alexandria says:** Well, I must say that I did not expect you to progress in your training at the rate you have. I also knew there was something that separated you from our other initiates. For your final test, I will need you to collect journal pages from the Ultricle. Provide me with three journal pages to receive your reward. You have come too far to fail me now. I hope to see you soon...alive, that is.
